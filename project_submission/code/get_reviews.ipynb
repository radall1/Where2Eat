Instead of going to our usual burger place, five guys, we decided to head for pizza. Instead of going to the North End we decided to stop into the 1000 degrees pizza shop. Upon our arrival, we were met with heavenly glowing orange walls, lack of music and the sound of an industrial ovens hum and dateline NBC coming from 2 different televisions right next to each other. We were met by a pleasantly harsh woman. Very kind, but her manner was rough. No problem, manners is all I ask for as a patron. We got the \"white out\" and two drinks. However over priced compared to higher quality pizzas in the north end, it was not upset. Then it happened... A strange woman and her son sitting in the booth next to us were preparing to leave. I kept making odd eye contact with the son. Who had a full beard and some of his coca cola would remain by his chin every time he took a sip. Their body language was utterly disturbing. The sad look in their eyes was upsetting and their shy manner was skin crawling. As people normally do, the older woman set sail for the bathroom. This is when things went awry. When she entered the bathroom, who's door was already wide open, the toilet and sink were met with a scream. Not fearful. Not in defense. But a war cry to set dominance over her surroundings. She closed the door and the son stood guard with his coca cola dripping like fresh blood from his bearded face. The screams were like none other. It sounded as though the fear of God was bestowed upon her at that toilet. Clouds rolled over head outside and it seemed as though it got suddenly dark. As the banging on the wall ensued, everyone remained casual and decided to ignore the impending doom. She exited the bathroom. Gathered her belongings. And the dark knight that was her son who defended her valiantly left the building. Once again, we were met with the harsh hum of an industrial oven and dateline nbc</td>\n",

       "      <td>I came to this restaurant to eat Hunan food with a friend from New York, and it turned out to be the most disappointing experience. First of all, the restaurant's door is locked from the inside, it needs to be eaten, and a person opens the door and leads the seat. This feels very strange, even if it is the new crown relationship, I have never seen a restaurant do business. Ordered Xiao Long Bao and Fried Rice Cake. Fried rice cakes have no other taste except salty. It’s pickled vegetables. Put some small green vegetables and stir fry, it won't cost much, and it tastes delicious. The pickled vegetables are cheap, you really sell me once and not a second time. Two drawers of Xiaolong Bao, I really don’t know the source of this steamed bun, Shanghai? Hangzhou? Beijing. There are no tastes anywhere, only one tasteless. The price is not cheap. But in Boston, the price is not comparable. Disappointment will be disappointed. Because of the new crown, many restaurants have bad business. I tip more than usual. These waiters rely on consumption to support their families. But I have never seen a restaurant automatically add consumption directly to the consumption meal, and a price. A tip of more than 6 yuan, not much. I thought it was a consumption tax. I plan to add two yuan to the consumption tax x2, half of which is a 20% tip. As a result, there was no place to write the total amount, only one place for signature. I'm still surprised, don't you only accept cash for tips? Take a closer look at the result, people have already added the tip to the ledger. This makes me feel upset immediately, let alone how unpalatable things are. During the entire dining process, except for the effort of serving the dishes, the waiter didn't even see a ghost, as if the guests were covered with viruses. So afraid of death, you just don't do business after the door is closed. No one wants to go out to eat and receive this treatment and voluntarily tip you. I told the waiter: Your food is so unpalatable, why do you think you should give a tip? The waiter said: It’s not my fault that the food is unpalatable. Most people will give tips. I feel that this girl should really investigate the origin of a small \"tip\". Why do people give tips when they eat? Your food is so unpalatable and the service is so bad: which point should you tip? I should have put you a penny on the table.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I didn't think Chinatown had more pleasant surprises in store--but thank goodness Burbor Cha Cha proved me wrong! We stopped by for dinner around 8pm on a Saturday night and found the place packed. There isn't much room to wait for a table, but it's worth standing around. The host kept us informed, so even though we waited 10 minutes or so, we weren't left hanging. Once we sat down, the decor really started to sink in. It can seem a little over the top at first, but really, there's a lot of thought put into this place and the bamboo, vines, and murals give it a classier feel than some of the plain-jane cafes that serve good food without worrying about making a good visual impression. I realized it could be seen as Chinatown's answer to some of the over-the-top decor in the North End: either way, you can walk in in jeans or take your boss or a date without feeling overdressed. There's more to this place than just the atmosphere, though. The food is fabulous. They pull out all the stops offering equally delicious traditional and \"Americanized\" dishes. For a party of three, we went for a jumbo shrimp dish with vegetables, orange chicken, watercress, and a white rice for each of us. There was plenty to go around, and I was happy to find that the vegetables (even the broccoli served with the orange chicken) were fresh, perfectly cooked, and balanced the protein in the dishes well. And everything was DELICIOUS to boot. Bubor Cha Cha is definitely a new favorite for me, and I'd highly recommend it to anyone</td>\n",

       "      <td>I work in downtown Boston and was looking for a cheap good Thai spot to grab a quick meal without waiting too long. As usual I logged on to Yelp! to find something good within walking distance. Of course I find a good spot thanks to all the previous reviews! It's only about a 7 minute walk from the Chinatown station and it's right off the corner of Beach Street. The ambiance is pretty cool and I'll definitely be convincing a friend or two to go and have a sit in meal. I saw some people who looked like they were eating on their own, couples, and a few families. The meals looked legit. I wish I knew more about Asian cuisine so I could go ham in this place. As for the take out, I got classic Pad Thai with shrimp. It's steaming hot and sitting in front of me at this moment. The lunch special is less than $10 and includes two spring rolls and fried tofu with generous amounts of shrimp and a generous helping of nuts. It's a little spicy and that's how I like it. Most Pad Thai that I'm used to tends to be a little on the sweet side. I had a left over crab cake from last nights dinner to add to the mix and it made my lunch complete. The lunch special is def worth two meals for me as I am a light eater but it's a generous helping for anyone else. I'm only giving it 4 stars because this is the first time I've been there and I've only tried one thing. Who knows, I might be going back for more and will add another star in the mix, until then, go check um out</td>\n",

Everywhere else was very busy, but they had several open tables. Wasn't quite sure what to expect. All i knew was that I was starving and needed to get some food in me.  I wanted to try several things, so I ordered the Appetizer Combo (A15), with Boneless Rib, Crab Rangoon, Chicken Fingers, and Chicken Wings. I must warn you that everything i fried. Although it tasted okay, I felt a bit gross after eating all this fried food. Boneless Rib was my least favorite item from this combo, and liked the chicken wings the most. Overall, this dish wasn't very appetizing. Wish I had ordered something less greasy, and with a bit more flavor. I also wanted a noodle dish, so I got the Chicken Chow Fun with gravy. It was a some standard Chow Fun. Not a whole lot going on. If I weren't dining alone, I would have ordered a couple of other dishes to try.  Not the best service. The guy brought me water, took my order, brought my food and disappeared. Didn't check up on me after either. I eventually walked up to the counter to ask for my bill and paid. Then left. So many options in the area, likely never coming back</td>\n",

They didn't even try to clean the table, they just took a towel and brushed bits of food off the table and on to the chairs and they didn't bother to clean that up. And that's not even the worst part. We ordered a lot of food and had duplicates of dishes and the dishes came out different times so it was hard to keep track and remember if we order one or two of the same dish. Their portion of food was fairly large (which was the only perk). After they told us they had finished serving our dishes, we finished our food and had to flag down someone for our check. We noticed that they charged us for 2 orders of a dish when we only received 1 order and it would of been fine if it happened to one dish but it happened for multiple orders that we were charged for 2 orders and we only recived one. We informed them and they told us that they didn't even keep track of what dishes that we received so we had to pay for dishes that we didn't even receive. I don't recommend coming here, but if you do, keep track of your order and good luck. This restaurant is unsanitary and their workers will give you attitude and try to ignore you</td>\n",

On our way to uno dos go, we were met by an unpleasant surprise. It was closed. Instead of going to our usual burger place, five guys, we decided to head for pizza. Instead of going to the North End we decided to stop into the 1000 degrees pizza shop. Upon our arrival, we were met with heavenly glowing orange walls, lack of music and the sound of an industrial ovens hum and dateline NBC coming from 2 different televisions right next to each other. We were met by a pleasantly harsh woman. Very kind, but her manner was rough. No problem, manners is all I ask for as a patron. We got the \"white out\" and two drinks. However over priced compared to higher quality pizzas in the north end, it was not upset. Then it happened... A strange woman and her son sitting in the booth next to us were preparing to leave. I kept making odd eye contact with the son. Who had a full beard and some of his coca cola would remain by his chin every time he took a sip. Their body language was utterly disturbing. The sad look in their eyes was upsetting and their shy manner was skin crawling. As people normally do, the older woman set sail for the bathroom. This is when things went awry. When she entered the bathroom, who's door was already wide open, the toilet and sink were met with a scream. Not fearful. Not in defense. But a war cry to set dominance over her surroundings. She closed the door and the son stood guard with his coca cola dripping like fresh blood from his bearded face. The screams were like none other. It sounded as though the fear of God was bestowed upon her at that toilet. Clouds rolled over head outside and it seemed as though it got suddenly dark. As the banging on the wall ensued, everyone remained casual and decided to ignore the impending doom. She exited the bathroom. Gathered her belongings. And the dark knight that was her son who defended her valiantly left the building. Once again, we were met with the harsh hum of an industrial oven and dateline nbc   \n",

I used to go there pretty regularly, but think I hit my limit with today's order.  They run build your own deals that are cheap, but if you buy any other pizza that has less toppings, they charge you a lot more. Their sales do not make sense.  Secondly, I normally order buffalo pizza's and sometimes they use the utensils to measure portion everything correctly and you get a REALLY good pizza. Other times the staff has not used utensils and you get basically get baked dough, coated with hot sauce, and with a unreasonably small sprinkle of cheese to the point I do not consider it a pizza.  I loved the concept of the restaurant, but it is poorly executed by inexperienced staff who lacks the concept of using consistent portioning to deliver quality pizzas which attracts repeat clientele   \n",

As soon as we entered such a great and friendly atmosphere. The lady was super helpful and explained to us different ways we could order. Since we have never been here she suggested a few places to visit. We told her we were on our honeymoon we just got married Saturday. After chatting with her for a bit she told us the food was on the house. I would come back here in a heart beat. Thank you so so much for everything pizza was amazing. Everyone needs to try this place  :   \n",

The pizza tastes good and the topping selection is good, however the people working there seemed very new on the job, and not sure how to go about things. There was a drink fridge that was completely empty, so crushed red pepper or parm out and about to bring with your take out. A co worker with me tried to order one of the pizzas from the online menu and the worker didn't know how to make it and it was not on the menu in the store   \n",

Personal cheese pizzas are $5 so we got two and we did the build your own roman pizza. The sriracha marinara was great. Online ordering is very easy and the pizza is good. Roman pizza is on the smaller side, though so order a bit more than you think you need   \n",

       "8963  I came to this restaurant to eat Hunan food with a friend from New York, and it turned out to be the most disappointing experience. First of all, the restaurant's door is locked from the inside, it needs to be eaten, and a person opens the door and leads the seat. This feels very strange, even if it is the new crown relationship, I have never seen a restaurant do business. Ordered Xiao Long Bao and Fried Rice Cake. Fried rice cakes have no other taste except salty. It’s pickled vegetables. Put some small green vegetables and stir fry, it won't cost much, and it tastes delicious. The pickled vegetables are cheap, you really sell me once and not a second time. Two drawers of Xiaolong Bao, I really don’t know the source of this steamed bun, Shanghai? Hangzhou? Beijing. There are no tastes anywhere, only one tasteless. The price is not cheap. But in Boston, the price is not comparable. Disappointment will be disappointed. Because of the new crown, many restaurants have bad business. I tip more than usual. These waiters rely on consumption to support their families. But I have never seen a restaurant automatically add consumption directly to the consumption meal, and a price. A tip of more than 6 yuan, not much. I thought it was a consumption tax. I plan to add two yuan to the consumption tax x2, half of which is a 20% tip. As a result, there was no place to write the total amount, only one place for signature. I'm still surprised, don't you only accept cash for tips? Take a closer look at the result, people have already added the tip to the ledger. This makes me feel upset immediately, let alone how unpalatable things are. During the entire dining process, except for the effort of serving the dishes, the waiter didn't even see a ghost, as if the guests were covered with viruses. So afraid of death, you just don't do business after the door is closed. No one wants to go out to eat and receive this treatment and voluntarily tip you. I told the waiter: Your food is so unpalatable, why do you think you should give a tip? The waiter said: It’s not my fault that the food is unpalatable. Most people will give tips. I feel that this girl should really investigate the origin of a small \"tip\". Why do people give tips when they eat? Your food is so unpalatable and the service is so bad: which point should you tip? I should have put you a penny on the table.   \n",

We stopped by for dinner around 8pm on a Saturday night and found the place packed. There isn't much room to wait for a table, but it's worth standing around. The host kept us informed, so even though we waited 10 minutes or so, we weren't left hanging. Once we sat down, the decor really started to sink in. It can seem a little over the top at first, but really, there's a lot of thought put into this place and the bamboo, vines, and murals give it a classier feel than some of the plain-jane cafes that serve good food without worrying about making a good visual impression. I realized it could be seen as Chinatown's answer to some of the over-the-top decor in the North End: either way, you can walk in in jeans or take your boss or a date without feeling overdressed. There's more to this place than just the atmosphere, though. The food is fabulous. They pull out all the stops offering equally delicious traditional and \"Americanized\" dishes. For a party of three, we went for a jumbo shrimp dish with vegetables, orange chicken, watercress, and a white rice for each of us. There was plenty to go around, and I was happy to find that the vegetables (even the broccoli served with the orange chicken) were fresh, perfectly cooked, and balanced the protein in the dishes well. And everything was DELICIOUS to boot. Bubor Cha Cha is definitely a new favorite for me, and I'd highly recommend it to anyone   \n",

As usual I logged on to Yelp! to find something good within walking distance. Of course I find a good spot thanks to all the previous reviews! It's only about a 7 minute walk from the Chinatown station and it's right off the corner of Beach Street. The ambiance is pretty cool and I'll definitely be convincing a friend or two to go and have a sit in meal. I saw some people who looked like they were eating on their own, couples, and a few families. The meals looked legit. I wish I knew more about Asian cuisine so I could go ham in this place. As for the take out, I got classic Pad Thai with shrimp. It's steaming hot and sitting in front of me at this moment. The lunch special is less than $10 and includes two spring rolls and fried tofu with generous amounts of shrimp and a generous helping of nuts. It's a little spicy and that's how I like it. Most Pad Thai that I'm used to tends to be a little on the sweet side. I had a left over crab cake from last nights dinner to add to the mix and it made my lunch complete. The lunch special is def worth two meals for me as I am a light eater but it's a generous helping for anyone else. I'm only giving it 4 stars because this is the first time I've been there and I've only tried one thing. Who knows, I might be going back for more and will add another star in the mix, until then, go check um out   \n",

I had just arrived in Boston. After aimlessly wandering around Chinatown, I finally settled for Bubor Cha Cha. Everywhere else was very busy, but they had several open tables. Wasn't quite sure what to expect. All i knew was that I was starving and needed to get some food in me.  I wanted to try several things, so I ordered the Appetizer Combo (A15), with Boneless Rib, Crab Rangoon, Chicken Fingers, and Chicken Wings. I must warn you that everything i fried. Although it tasted okay, I felt a bit gross after eating all this fried food. Boneless Rib was my least favorite item from this combo, and liked the chicken wings the most. Overall, this dish wasn't very appetizing. Wish I had ordered something less greasy, and with a bit more flavor. I also wanted a noodle dish, so I got the Chicken Chow Fun with gravy. It was a some standard Chow Fun. Not a whole lot going on. If I weren't dining alone, I would have ordered a couple of other dishes to try.  Not the best service. The guy brought me water, took my order, brought my food and disappeared. Didn't check up on me after either. I eventually walked up to the counter to ask for my bill and paid. Then left.

They didn't even try to clean the table, they just took a towel and brushed bits of food off the table and on to the chairs and they didn't bother to clean that up. And that's not even the worst part. We ordered a lot of food and had duplicates of dishes and the dishes came out different times so it was hard to keep track and remember if we order one or two of the same dish. Their portion of food was fairly large (which was the only perk). After they told us they had finished serving our dishes, we finished our food and had to flag down someone for our check. We noticed that they charged us for 2 orders of a dish when we only received 1 order and it would of been fine if it happened to one dish but it happened for multiple orders that we were charged for 2 orders and we only recived one. We informed them and they told us that they didn't even keep track of what dishes that we received so we had to pay for dishes that we didn't even receive. I don't recommend coming here, but if you do, keep track of your order and good luck. This restaurant is unsanitary and their workers will give you attitude and try to ignore you   \n",

On our way to uno dos go, we were met by an unpleasant surprise. It was closed. Instead of going to our usual burger place, five guys, we decided to head for pizza. Instead of going to the North End we decided to stop into the 1000 degrees pizza shop. Upon our arrival, we were met with heavenly glowing orange walls, lack of music and the sound of an industrial ovens hum and dateline NBC coming from 2 different televisions right next to each other. We were met by a pleasantly harsh woman. Very kind, but her manner was rough. No problem, manners is all I ask for as a patron. We got the \"white out\" and two drinks. However over priced compared to higher quality pizzas in the north end, it was not upset. Then it happened... A strange woman and her son sitting in the booth next to us were preparing to leave. I kept making odd eye contact with the son. Who had a full beard and some of his coca cola would remain by his chin every time he took a sip. Their body language was utterly disturbing. The sad look in their eyes was upsetting and their shy manner was skin crawling. As people normally do, the older woman set sail for the bathroom. This is when things went awry. When she entered the bathroom, who's door was already wide open, the toilet and sink were met with a scream. Not fearful. Not in defense. But a war cry to set dominance over her surroundings. She closed the door and the son stood guard with his coca cola dripping like fresh blood from his bearded face. The screams were like none other. It sounded as though the fear of God was bestowed upon her at that toilet. Clouds rolled over head outside and it seemed as though it got suddenly dark. As the banging on the wall ensued, everyone remained casual and decided to ignore the impending doom. She exited the bathroom. Gathered her belongings. And the dark knight that was her son who defended her valiantly left the building. Once again, we were met with the harsh hum of an industrial oven and dateline nbc   \n",

I used to go there pretty regularly, but think I hit my limit with today's order.  They run build your own deals that are cheap, but if you buy any other pizza that has less toppings, they charge you a lot more. Their sales do not make sense.  Secondly, I normally order buffalo pizza's and sometimes they use the utensils to measure portion everything correctly and you get a REALLY good pizza. Other times the staff has not used utensils and you get basically get baked dough, coated with hot sauce, and with a unreasonably small sprinkle of cheese to the point I do not consider it a pizza.  I loved the concept of the restaurant, but it is poorly executed by inexperienced staff who lacks the concept of using consistent portioning to deliver quality pizzas which attracts repeat clientele   \n",

As soon as we entered such a great and friendly atmosphere. The lady was super helpful and explained to us different ways we could order. Since we have never been here she suggested a few places to visit. We told her we were on our honeymoon we just got married Saturday. After chatting with her for a bit she told us the food was on the house. I would come back here in a heart beat. Thank you so so much for everything pizza was amazing. Everyone needs to try this place  :   \n",

The pizza tastes good and the topping selection is good, however the people working there seemed very new on the job, and not sure how to go about things. There was a drink fridge that was completely empty, so crushed red pepper or parm out and about to bring with your take out. A co worker with me tried to order one of the pizzas from the online menu and the worker didn't know how to make it and it was not on the menu in the store   \n",

Personal cheese pizzas are $5 so we got two and we did the build your own roman pizza. The sriracha marinara was great. Online ordering is very easy and the pizza is good. Roman pizza is on the smaller side, though so order a bit more than you think you need   \n",

       "8963  Name: 异国他湘 Bubor cha cha; Review: I came to this restaurant to eat Hunan food with a friend from New York, and it turned out to be the most disappointing experience. First of all, the restaurant's door is locked from the inside, it needs to be eaten, and a person opens the door and leads the seat. This feels very strange, even if it is the new crown relationship, I have never seen a restaurant do business. Ordered Xiao Long Bao and Fried Rice Cake. Fried rice cakes have no other taste except salty. It’s pickled vegetables. Put some small green vegetables and stir fry, it won't cost much, and it tastes delicious. The pickled vegetables are cheap, you really sell me once and not a second time. Two drawers of Xiaolong Bao, I really don’t know the source of this steamed bun, Shanghai? Hangzhou? Beijing. There are no tastes anywhere, only one tasteless. The price is not cheap. But in Boston, the price is not comparable. Disappointment will be disappointed. Because of the new crown, many restaurants have bad business. I tip more than usual. These waiters rely on consumption to support their families. But I have never seen a restaurant automatically add consumption directly to the consumption meal, and a price. A tip of more than 6 yuan, not much. I thought it was a consumption tax. I plan to add two yuan to the consumption tax x2, half of which is a 20% tip. As a result, there was no place to write the total amount, only one place for signature. I'm still surprised, don't you only accept cash for tips? Take a closer look at the result, people have already added the tip to the ledger. This makes me feel upset immediately, let alone how unpalatable things are. During the entire dining process, except for the effort of serving the dishes, the waiter didn't even see a ghost, as if the guests were covered with viruses. So afraid of death, you just don't do business after the door is closed. No one wants to go out to eat and receive this treatment and voluntarily tip you. I told the waiter: Your food is so unpalatable, why do you think you should give a tip? The waiter said: It’s not my fault that the food is unpalatable. Most people will give tips. I feel that this girl should really investigate the origin of a small \"tip\". Why do people give tips when they eat? Your food is so unpalatable and the service is so bad: which point should you tip? I should have put you a penny on the table.   \n",

We stopped by for dinner around 8pm on a Saturday night and found the place packed. There isn't much room to wait for a table, but it's worth standing around. The host kept us informed, so even though we waited 10 minutes or so, we weren't left hanging. Once we sat down, the decor really started to sink in. It can seem a little over the top at first, but really, there's a lot of thought put into this place and the bamboo, vines, and murals give it a classier feel than some of the plain-jane cafes that serve good food without worrying about making a good visual impression. I realized it could be seen as Chinatown's answer to some of the over-the-top decor in the North End: either way, you can walk in in jeans or take your boss or a date without feeling overdressed. There's more to this place than just the atmosphere, though. The food is fabulous. They pull out all the stops offering equally delicious traditional and \"Americanized\" dishes. For a party of three, we went for a jumbo shrimp dish with vegetables, orange chicken, watercress, and a white rice for each of us. There was plenty to go around, and I was happy to find that the vegetables (even the broccoli served with the orange chicken) were fresh, perfectly cooked, and balanced the protein in the dishes well. And everything was DELICIOUS to boot. Bubor Cha Cha is definitely a new favorite for me, and I'd highly recommend it to anyone   \n",

As usual I logged on to Yelp! to find something good within walking distance. Of course I find a good spot thanks to all the previous reviews! It's only about a 7 minute walk from the Chinatown station and it's right off the corner of Beach Street. The ambiance is pretty cool and I'll definitely be convincing a friend or two to go and have a sit in meal. I saw some people who looked like they were eating on their own, couples, and a few families. The meals looked legit. I wish I knew more about Asian cuisine so I could go ham in this place. As for the take out, I got classic Pad Thai with shrimp. It's steaming hot and sitting in front of me at this moment. The lunch special is less than $10 and includes two spring rolls and fried tofu with generous amounts of shrimp and a generous helping of nuts. It's a little spicy and that's how I like it. Most Pad Thai that I'm used to tends to be a little on the sweet side. I had a left over crab cake from last nights dinner to add to the mix and it made my lunch complete. The lunch special is def worth two meals for me as I am a light eater but it's a generous helping for anyone else. I'm only giving it 4 stars because this is the first time I've been there and I've only tried one thing. Who knows, I might be going back for more and will add another star in the mix, until then, go check um out   \n",

I had just arrived in Boston. After aimlessly wandering around Chinatown, I finally settled for Bubor Cha Cha. Everywhere else was very busy, but they had several open tables. Wasn't quite sure what to expect. All i knew was that I was starving and needed to get some food in me.  I wanted to try several things, so I ordered the Appetizer Combo (A15), with Boneless Rib, Crab Rangoon, Chicken Fingers, and Chicken Wings. I must warn you that everything i fried. Although it tasted okay, I felt a bit gross after eating all this fried food. Boneless Rib was my least favorite item from this combo, and liked the chicken wings the most. Overall, this dish wasn't very appetizing. Wish I had ordered something less greasy, and with a bit more flavor. I also wanted a noodle dish, so I got the Chicken Chow Fun with gravy. It was a some standard Chow Fun. Not a whole lot going on. If I weren't dining alone, I would have ordered a couple of other dishes to try.  Not the best service. The guy brought me water, took my order, brought my food and disappeared. Didn't check up on me after either. I eventually walked up to the counter to ask for my bill and paid. Then left. So many options in the area, likely never coming back   \n",

They didn't even try to clean the table, they just took a towel and brushed bits of food off the table and on to the chairs and they didn't bother to clean that up. And that's not even the worst part. We ordered a lot of food and had duplicates of dishes and the dishes came out different times so it was hard to keep track and remember if we order one or two of the same dish. Their portion of food was fairly large (which was the only perk). After they told us they had finished serving our dishes, we finished our food and had to flag down someone for our check. We noticed that they charged us for 2 orders of a dish when we only received 1 order and it would of been fine if it happened to one dish but it happened for multiple orders that we were charged for 2 orders and we only recived one. We informed them and they told us that they didn't even keep track of what dishes that we received so we had to pay for dishes that we didn't even receive. I don't recommend coming here, but if you do, keep track of your order and good luck. This restaurant is unsanitary and their workers will give you attitude and try to ignore you   \n",

       "      <td>Name: Darryl's Corner Bar &amp; Kitchen; Review: Darryl’s in two words: “Never again.”  Please don’t make the same mistake we made; take your business elsewhere.  We waited nearly an hour for four appetizers. After I asked the “server” (I use the word loosely) to cancel the appetizers (because I assumed the entrees would be arriving in any minute), three of the appetizers finally appeared.  The fourth appetizer—a spinach salad—never did show up. Somehow, the kitchen was able to prepare one spinach salad for our table, but the second was evidently too high a bar to clear.  When the appetizers arrived, the manager assured me that the entrees were right behind them. He also looked me in the eye and (as it turned out) lied to me, saying that one entree (a grilled chicken sandwich) in particular was holding things up, but those entrees would be out shortly.  Three of the four entrees arrived after another wait, but that grilled chicken sandwich also turned out to be too much of a challenge for this establishment and it simply never arrived.  The kicker was this policy statement from their website: “To ensure that we can honor your reservations in a timely manner, we have a 2 hour maximum seating time during the prime times.” Deeply ironic, when, in the two hours we wasted at this establishment, this is a restaurant that couldn’t actually serve four appetizers and four entrees to four patrons.  At Darryl’s, to paraphrase P.T. Barnum, you can feed some of the people some of the time.  I have never written a review like this before, but, in two decades of restaurant-going as an adult, I’ve never seen “service” like this.  Two words—offered by either the “server” or the manager at any point—would have kept me from writing this review.  Darryl’s, say it with me, for future reference: “I’m sorry.”  Goodness knows you should be\\nName: Sorellina; Review: Sorellina is good, but not worth a 5 star rating.  We dined with them this past Saturday.  The atmosphere is sophisticated and classy.  While we saw a few t-shirts and a ball cap at one table, the dress is upscale casual.  A sport coat for guys and a dress for the ladies is spot on.  Their service was very good and our location by a window added to the evening.  We started off with several appetizers including the Polpo (octopus), Cavatelli (rabbit and pasta), and Maccheroncelli (meatball, sauce and parmigiana).  All were prepared excellent and challenged the palate with sophisticated tastes.  But that's where the good food ended and the main courses were average.  Two of us got the  Milanese which was presented well, but dry and with little flavor.  The other dishes, Veal saltimbocca, and the Filet Mignon were again bland.  I don't know why the appetizers could be so good and the mains fair at best.   For the prices paid one would expect much better than average.  The 4 stars is a reprieve do to the excellent appetizers, but if it wasn't for those it would have been a 3\\nName: Sky Restaurant; Review: We went to Sky this past weekend, and the experience was mixed.  I'll start with the bad.  The host at the front of the restaurant doesn't seem very friendly - no smiling at all and seemed a bit underdressed.  After sitting down and ordering a bottle of wine, the waitress poured us tastes of the wine and then left.  This seemed a bit odd, since every other restaurant usually pours the first glass. We sat for about 20 min before receiving bread and had to request it from one of the bussers.  We ordered two appetizers the chef board and the fried calamari.  Both of these appetizers were lackluster.  The fried calamari wasn't light and easy to eat, instead it was chewy and overly breaded.  Our entrees took over an hour to arrive at the table, but when they did the quality was excellent.  That brings me to the good, the swordfish I ordered was clearly fresh, and the filet my wife ordered was cooked perfectly.   With a bit of fine tuning on the service, better appetizers that match freshness of entress this place would be 4 stars in my book, but without those elements it falls a bit short\\nName: Chicken and Rice Guys; Review: Good food. Good quantity. Price is good for the amount of food available. Halal chicken is served with rice. It would be better if customers were able to choose between the type of salad they want with their order but overall a good experience\\nName: Turner Fisheries Restaurant &amp; Bar; Review: Our party of 6 went for drinks and appetizers in the bar early last Saturday evening.  Oysters and littleneck were fantastic, the drinks very good, and the service excellent.  One of the better fried calamari’s we’ve tasted and the chowder is wonderful</td>\n",

I ordered an appetizer, buffalo wing dings &amp; a side salad (to go). The portion sizes were huge &amp; the salad was very fresh. The atmosphere was great. It wasn't very busy but it had a warm, cozy feeling to it. I look forward to going back\\nName: The Hen House Wings 'n Waffles; Review: Ordered from here using the Caviar app. Bad decision  I ordered potato skins and the appetizer sampler. The potato skins were either over cooked or not cooked enough because they were hard in some spots and chewy. They tasted like they had been sitting under a light all day with melted cheese and bacon added right before I ordered them. The chicken tenders were over cooked for sure. Super hard and tasted like cardboard. The chicken wings had absolutely no flavor. The only thing that tasted halfway decent was the mozzarella sticks, but they were pretty oily and greasy. I wasted $25 for sure\\nName: Crave Chinatown; Review: Really good! Love how they have an extensive menu that tastes fresh and looks amazing! They also have a drinks menu that includes beer, martinis, cocktails, shots, and a scorpion bowl. Decently large place with decent space in between tables. Service is good but it can get busy on the weekends. People ranging from young to old come here and it's always lively! Bathrooms are in the back which are clean. Separate bathrooms for male and female. 1) Truffle fries with parmesan cheese - really good! Would definitely recommend. Warm and fresh. Super crunchy on the outside and soft potato on the inside. Comes with ketchup and chipotle mayo. Tip: dip the French fries in both sauces at the same time - tastes really good!! Rating: (5/5). 2) Fried rice with egg &amp; chicken - a little too Americanized for me. Standard fried rice. Could use more seasoning overall. Rating: (2/5). 3) Salmon &amp; Tuna Dumplings - REALLY good. It's basically shredded crabmeat and small chunks of lobster wrapped in raw salmon or raw tuna to look like a dumpling. Each dumpling is placed on a large spoon that has a ton of soy sauce on the bottom. The dumplings could do withOUT the soy sauce though. I would have preferred the soy sauce to be on the side so you could control how much soy sauce you're consuming. Regardless, it was still really good and would recommend. The dish includes 4 dumplings for $15. Rating: (4/5). 4) Hotate Hokkaiyaki - baked sea scallop in a large shell with crabmeat tobiko, enoki mushrooms, scallions topped with cheese and spicy mayo served sizzling on a burner. It looks cool and tastes good and fresh! But probably wouldn't get it again. Too much shredded crabmeat and you could really taste the mayo. However I couldn't taste the cheese (which I'm thankful for tbh). An interesting dish though. Dish costed $13. Rating: (4/5). 5) Fried Chicken - size: medium, which consisted of 10 drumsticks. There are around 6 different flavours on believe. We got Soy Garlic and Angry. Soy garlic is mild while Angry has a spicy kick to it (Sriracha spicy level). Chicken was super juicy and decently sized! The fried breading was really good - crunchy, well flavored, and not too oily. Would definitely recommend the soy garlic and definitely the fried chicken. Rating: (5/5)\\nName: Domenic's; Review: 4 stars. Food was great, fabulous eggplant appetizer, meatballs were terrific.  Great presentation of chicken piccata with roasted  brussels sprouts and êxcellent potatoes. Interesting pâsta shapes w chicken parm. Nice fresh Caesar salad. A variety of cocktails...I liked the one with hibiscus. Only thing missing : no coffee &amp; đêssert, but they are pretty nêw, maybe that will come in time, but in the North End, those never far away. Sorry I didn't take pictures of the food.

The alcohol drinks were not bad. Our appetizer mozzarella sticks were perfect as was the sauce and the burgers looked so good we didn't even want to touch it. Luckily it tasted as good as it looked. Seems like it had a seasoning to it which put some flavor in it. Those seasoned fries too were amazing. Our waitress with the blonde hair did a great job. Very friendly and attentive. Give her a raise! We will come back agai\\n\\nName: Fool's Errand; Review: I LOVE what they’ve got going here. Chef Faison’s concept is so great here - excellently crafted drinks and just plain-ol great snacks. They’re not afraid to serve you raclette, beautiful bread and fresh whipped butter, nor do they shy away from something bougie like caviar, but they’re not afraid to dish it out with a single-serving size bag of classic Lays chips. I love the juxtaposition! It’s so welcoming, like it’s just great drinks and great snacks and everything is just grounded in what tastes good! Also, highest rated bathroom in Boston by far, so how can one not like this place</td>\n",

After the drink, I wanted one appetizer and the main course, so I asked my server about some recommendations. He just showed me the menu again. Afterwards, I asked him about the size of the calamari, he said that it is just an appetizer, and it would be ok  if I have it as an appetizer.

Made reservations for Friday night (as you should for any restaurant in that area) and everything was exceptional! Big thanks to Roy, our server Sam, and all the other staff who were attentive and kind to our party. Between the 5 of us we tried the highly recommended blackened octopus, the oysters, the french onion macaroni and cheese, the spicy fried cauliflower, the Nashville hot chicken thighs, the chicken wings, the biscuits, and the beignets. Every single plate was delicious!! The cauliflower was crispy and paired with a great creamy sauce, the mac and cheese was baked well and oozing with flavor inside, the octopus was very flavorful and wasn't overcooked, and both the wings and thighs were fought over! And the biscuits... there aren't words to describe how perfectly crispy and sweet they were on top and how salty and fluffy they were on the inside and on top of it all they're MASSIVE and paired with a great cinnamon butter dip and another cheese dip that we took to go. The beignets were equally as tantalizing - super soft and sweet and on second thought we should've ordered a second plate of them to bring home...The drinks were all exceptional too, ask for whatever is popular - can't remember all the names but we ran through 3 or different 4 mixes (the whodi smash was the last one I had - its strong and made with Woodford bourbon 🙂) I can't say enough good things about this place - just go, eat, and enjoy\\n\\nName: Sawa Hibachi Steakhouse and Sushi; Review: Food Court quality at dine-in prices , we ordered 4 dinners and 4 appetizers to test the menu place was semi empty food came almost too quickly  a bad sign the appetizers were underwhelming amd the real disappointment was the dinners , swimming in Sugary syrup were soggy vegetables and cold microwave rice , decorations were swanky hookah bar theme in a japanese steak house , no wagu beef  choices no imagination and bad execution, I am done with mall eateries that disguise themselves as big city high quality nuveau cuisine when its only a panda express at best go if you ilke a low key private setting since you’re the only one there ar\\n\\nName: Les Zygomates Wine Bar &amp; Bistro; Review: So apparently Zygomates is under new ownership with a new chef and I was lucky enough to be invited to taste their menu and besides for a few small misses the meal was a hit. The staff was phenomenal and did a great job explaining the dishes as they were dropped off to the table, which in my opinion doesn't happen enough in higher end restaurants. Les Zygomates is also in the middle of a renovation and from what was completed it looked pretty sharp.  Here is what I tasted:  Charcuterie - Great little board with a focus on duck. Duck pastrami and the pate were great  House made duck confit nuggets - I was just able to try one of these. Great concept, as someone who loves duck I think these were spot on. Crunchy on the outside and flavorful on the inside  Smoked Salmon - This was a highlight of the meal and I'm not usually a smoked salmon fan. It was served on top of a chip and I found it very flavorful  Poached Shrimp - This was also served on some type of chip, it was good but I thought it was just good shrimp on a chip  southeast Asian Mussels - Another highlight of the meal. I think the whole table was caught off guard at how good these tasted and the presentation. The curry and coconut flavors were perfect but not overpowering.  Gnocchi in a Garlic Cream Sauce w/ Escargot and Lamb Bacon - This was hands down my favorite dish. I wasn't sure if I would dig the lamb bacon but it helped perfect the complex flavor profile. The fresh gnocchi's were almost slightly crispy which I enjoyed.  Lobster Bisque - I've never had lobster bisque with a puff pastry on top but it was a welcome addition. There were a few chunks of lobster in there as well.  Bone in Veal - While I wouldn't normally order giant hunks of meat while at dinner if this is your style then this is a killer dish. The veal had a great crust that was just crispy enough and flavorful. It was cooked perfectly medium rare.  Creme Brulee - Not much else to say other than it was a perfect rendition of this classic dessert  Lemon Souffle - I never tried a lemon souffle before but I really enjoyed the tart and fruity flavors of this dish. Seems like a great palette cleanser to end a meal.  Baked Alaska - One of the best presented dishes of the night. They lit it on fire tableside. As far as taste goes I found it a little too boozey and thought the chocolate ice cream inside wasn't a good fi</td>\n",

Most impressive is the quality of the bartenders and second to that is quality of the ingredients.  My go to place for a good beer or outstanding drink when I'm in the area.  The cafe offers great pastries to bring home. Never been let down. The kids who work there seem like Political Science majors; but with $12.00 bucks an hour coming their way - nothing can stop them now.  Check this place out</td>\n",
       "      <td>Name: Minibar; Review: The interior decor and specialty cocktails made this bar very Miami-esque. I found the drink prices reasonable, because I don't mind paying for creative concoctions with a kick. But I bet others would find them overpriced. The actual bar is quite small so I'd imagine it takes a little while to get a drink when the place is crowded. But overall I would recommend this lounge-style location for its ambiance and fun liquors\\n\\nName: Better Sorts Social Club; Review: Best cocktails around!  The space is so luxe - ambient lighting, plush furniture, crystal glassware... a truly upscale experience.  They have seasonal cocktails (as well as year-round), an extensive wine &amp; liquor list, and food/snacks.  It's the perfect place to relax with a cocktail and friends or a date.  They also have spirit-free cocktail options which came in handy for my pregnant friend.  I bring all my out-of-town guests here.  We had a hard time finding it the first time - the doors to enter are right on Tremont street.  Highly recommend\\n\\nName: Four Winds; Review: LOVE the bartenders and the new menu is amazing! It's my local spot and always will be :\\n\\nName: The Boston Shaker; Review: This smartly-designed Davis Square shop stocks just about everything you need to craft perfect drinks at home or on-the-job at a professional bar. Don't be fooled by the modest size of this boutique; inside lies an emporium-like inventory of bitters, glassware, and cocktail books.  Adam and his staff are incredibly knowledgeable and enthusiastic about what they do. Whether you're in search of a gift, in need of basics for cocktailing at home, or looking for the latest addition to your professional bar arsenal, they'll be sure to steer you in the right direction.  No booze? No problem - you won't need to go far. Dave's Fresh Pasta, just steps away, carries an impressive selection of vermouth and aperitif liqueurs. Meanwhile, Downtown Wine &amp; Spirits, also nearby, boasts a great selection of full-strength spirits\\n\\nName: Merrill &amp; Co.; Review: The space is updated from the 28 Degrees decor, with the new layout both making it more open while also increasing the number of distinct, comfortable spaces within the restaurant. There's a small but solid craft beer selection, really great comfort food in shareable plates, and excellent cocktails. This is a laid back spot off the beaten path, but it's walkable from Boylston and Back Bay bars - and worth the trek if you're looking for something friendly, comfortable and still classy enough for solid cocktails</td>\n",

       "      <td>Name: La Galleria 33; Review: They need Gordon Ramsey to come back.  When entering the host was wearing a hoodie.  As we walked through the North End we had a concern because all of the restaurants were full and seemed very busy.  Not the case upon our arrival at La Galleria.  There was only 3 or 4 other tables with guests.  The overwhelming smell of this Italian restaurant is not garlic, fresh tomatoes or the essence of fine Italian food being cooked, for example the smells one enjoys while walking by the nearby restaurants.  What do you smell from the open kitchen?  The fryer that smells like old oil, Ugh.  The quality and freshness of the food (muscles, tomatoes on Brushetta, Halibut) was excellent.  However, the preparation was nothing you would go out of your way for.  The burning question would I go back, probably not.  If you are in Boston for only a few days  this is not as expensive as other nearby places the food is OK and you should be able to get a reservation.  If your looking for authentic Italian food, this is not the place.  It is neither romantic or funky.  They had a TV on the wall with a basket ball game and kind of indy rock on the stereo.  It was just really odd and wouldn't want to dine here with friends as it isn't a warm comfortable place even though the exposed brick was warm and welcomin\\nName: Coolidge Market; Review: Was skeptical about the outside of the place but a friend told me that the Italian sub is the best. For $4.50 you can get the best Italian sub in the city. It was absolutely delicious, and made with love by a little old woman. 100000% recommend. Although I am sad that no other Italian sandwich will compare\\nName: Punto Rojo; Review: The best Colombian restaurant I have been in this country !! I live in NY and I came to visit Boston and this place really made me happy with its food and good service, the price for the quality and quantity of food is more than perfect !! I looked at many Reviews of restaurants nearby and this was the best and the best choice! All very tasty!\\nName: Casalinga; Review: Being an Italian raised in East Boston I rarely find authentic Italian cuisine when I dine out. This is not the case at Casalinga. The arincinis ( rice balls ) are delicious, the lobster ravioli tender and flavorful, and the eggplant parmesan wonderful. Superb quality Italian cooking at a very reasonable price. A hidden gem\\nName: Oliver Street Cafe; Review: I've honestly never had an Italian sub like this one. It will change your life</td>\n",
       "      <td>Name: D'Parma Italian Cuisine; Review: Stopped by at midnight after picking a friend up at nearby Logan Airport. Late-night food is in desperately short supply in Boston, particularly decent sit-down civilized restaurant style. This was a great find.  I had the Salad D'Parma with steak tips, he the Fettuccine Alfredo with chicken and broccoli - both were excellent. We also appreciated the waitress regularly checking in that everything was going well.  Glad to now have a great goto in East Boston\\nName: Linguine's Italian Eatery; Review: My go-to lunch spot in Marlboro. They have great pasta dishes, subs (love the chicken parmesan!), pizza, and traditional Italian chicken/veal dishes. I usual get a salad that can be topped with grilled chicken, but they will slice a breaded chicken breast instead upon request. The homemade house thick creamy Italian dressing is the best I've found anywhere, and they serve everything with warm pizza dough rolls. Even watching carbs, I can't help but dip a roll in the dressing.  My other favorite lunch is in the winter, they often have either chicken escarole or escarole bean soup (larger bowl). Both are packed with chicken/veggies/beans.  During the day, you order at the counter, and seat yourself. I believe they have wait service at night. I look forward to the days I work in Marlboro just for the Linguine's lunch\\nName: Alfredo's Italian Kitchen/SOUTH BOSTON; Review: Okay, our first night in Boston we looked up places to get great Italian food. Yelp rated this place as far and they were like over a thousand reviews so of course that's where we headed. Little did we know that it's just a stand on the corner of two streets and it's only pick up or carry out, we had no clue. So we left that place on our first night although the menu looked phenomenal and the smell was amazing. However The night before we left we returned and picked up some pizza. It was delicious. I think if I lived in Boston or had more time in Boston I would have been there more frequently. It did look like there were several little shops like this one, this one was just near our b&amp;b and caught our attention. As long as you're okay with just take out or delivery, this is a place I would recommend\\nName: Artu; Review: I try not to eat at the same restaurant twice in the North End, but Artu may need an exemption from this rule. My date and I both agreed that the food was fantastic Sat night. Appetizer was a ricotta wrapped in eggplant, for dinner she ordered the Fusilli e Salsicce con Broccoli Rabe with Sausage and I got the Pollo Arrabiata. The appetizer was definitely the highlight of the evening. For dinner: pasta was perfectly cooked, my chicken dish was spicy, sauces were not too thick/watery and the portions were a reasonable size (nothing left for lunch the next day). No valet parking for Artu, I valeted my car @Mamma Maria for $25. I'd highly recommend\\nName: 5 North Square; Review: We had a delightful lunch of individual real Italian pizzas.  The dough was thin, ingredients fresh, service good and attentive.  Wine list adequate.  Nice street view with plenty local color.

Try Maurizio's Involtini di Melanzane (rolled slices of eggplant stuffed with ricotta cheese, basil, sun dried tomatoes and parmesan cheese, topped with tomato sauce) as an appetizer, and then the Linguine ai Frutti di Mare (shrimp, scallops, clams, mussels and calamari served in a spicy lobster based tomato sauce and tossed with linguine) as a main course.  Ask Linda to choose a bottle of wine for you. Maurizio's food is proof of the existence of God.

It's more of a take out business then sit down spot, but the place is so quaint and oozes Italian flare, you should grab a seat. You won't get diligent server assistance as they are geared to take out.  But the food is sooo good you won't care.  The chef/cook couldn't be more pleased to have you at Dinos.  I had fettuccine with sausage in garlic cream sauce.  I was offered extra bread for the A+ sauce. Amazing food for some of the BEST prices in Boston.  Try it</td>\n",
       "      <td>Name: Papa's Pizza Company; Review: My family and I were in town last week visiting relatives and they decided one night to order out pizza.  They knew of Papa's and highly recommended it.  Boy, were they right!  The pizza got there quick, it was HOT, and it was incredible!  We ordered two extra larges (Margherita and Meat Lover) and everyone loved them!  The crusts and sauce were wonderful. (It took me back to my younger days when we would go out Sunday after church to our favorite Italian restaurant in Cleveland).  So I decided before we came home, I would have to take the family there to eat.  We arrived and though it was busy, we were seated immediately by a very courteous, friendly host.  Our server got to us quickly and got our drinks while making some suggestions for my wife and I as well as the kids.  Just like the take-out pizza, in in-house food was perfect as well!  Chicken Alfredo, Strawberry Walnut Salad, Meatball Sub, and my one kid actually ordered a Steak Teriyaki Bowl (at an italian restaurant????) and I was shocked at how good it was!  Even the Assistant Manager Konstantine came by to see how everything was.  He was a very nice young man.  Service was spot on without being overbearing.  Wish I could bring this place down to FL with me as well as give it more stars than just five\\n\\nName: Mario's Restaurant; Review: Mario's looks like the quintessential local Italian restaurant-- exposed brick walls, checkered table cloths, and a menu full of Italian comfort food.  After eating here twice, I find that it is really a disappointment. The food is suprisingly pricy considering the neighborhood and the interior of the restaurant. $17 for a pasta dish, anything with meat runs around $20, and seafood can top out next to $30. I don't mind paying that kind of money for good Italian food having grown up in Providence, but the food wasn't that much to write home about.  The pasta was overcooked, the razor-thin pounded veal lacked flavor and was soggy. The lobster in the pasta special was a bit rubbery. I know others have had a great experience at this restaurant, but for a local, casual Italian restaurant, the food isn't nearly good enough to justify prices that belong more in the North End than Eastie\\n\\nName: Rino's Place; Review: WoW, WoW, WoW! Every dish I got tonight was absolutely fabulous and when they came, they FLOOD! The wait was over two hours long on a Friday night by 8pm, so come early or come on a weekday!  Here's the gist: Get here, sign in, leave your number, go find a bar nearby, drink, wait, receive a call, and EAT!  The restaurant is small to keep the quality here as high as possible to the owner's desire. You will absolutely be stuffed coming out of this restaurant, so get one less dish than you think you want to order.  My order and take on it: CALAMARI - calamari battered &amp; fried and finished in a spicy pepper ring sauce $12 (OMG, the best calamari I have ever had because the taste is sooo complete! There's is no marinara or any sort of sauce needed for this dish. I don't know what it is, but the spicy pepper ring brings this dish a whole level up. Don't be scared, it's not spicy at all!)  VITELLO MARSALA - scallopini of veal sauteed with mushrooms and ham. Finished in a marsala wine sauce $12 (Veal is beaten down to a pulp with a layer of ham on top and another layer of cheese on top of that. It's so tender! Marsala sauce is perfect with this...if you don't want to carbo load, get any of the Marsala dishes depending what kind of meat you're craving for...yum!  GNOCCHI - homemade potato dumplings sauteed in a fresh plum tomato sauce and topped with fresh mozzarella and baked $15 (OMG, I could make this dish into four meals...it's so filling, but so worth it! The dish is perfectly cheesy and bouncy!)  LOBSTER RAVIOLI - Their star dish of Rino's and featured on FOOD network. It's absolutely the best lobster ravioli I have ever had and it's something you must get and share among your party. DO IT!  Frutti Di Mare - Seafood overload beyond belief. They do not skimp on their portion on this dish and it's so fresh! You get to pick whatever type of pasta you desire to complement this dish and I went with the fusilli pasta, yum!  Tiramisu - Perfect end to the meal and it's so creamy and delicious! You might as well pair it off with a cup of cappuccino or coffee :)  Overall, my dinner was a phenomenal experience at Rino's. I'm glad I got to try this restaurant and I can't wait to come back to Rino's sometime soon again.  PS. Parking is a pain here because it's packed in the residential area of Boston East, so carpool or take the T. The walk from the T is a bit far to Rino's, but it's doable!  Close on Sunday, hours below: Monday: 4pm - 9pm / Tuesday - Thursday: 11am - 9pm / Friday: 11am - 10pm / Saturday: 3pm - 10p\\n\\nName: Pini's Pizzeria; Review: This place really does have the best pizza in town and probably surrounding towns, although I can't confirm. Their delivery is really fast too. I forget about this place especially since I'm not driving by it every day but when I remember it exists and I want pizza this is definitely my go-to. The only \"issue\" is that outside of pizza their menu is pretty limited. My wife has a dairy allergy and doesn't like red sauce so she doesn't eat pizza much and if she does she gets one without cheese and sauce (Bianca) which she really likes but that's really the only thing she would like on the menu. Because of that, if we order takeout we need to order from a place that has a larger selection of subs/wraps/salads\\n\\nName: Babbo Pizzeria e Enoteca; Review: Wow we had the salads...pizzas and pastas. Now we're a party of 18, difficulty to please straight up Italians. Salad...arugula and tomato (tomatoes were incredible), summer Caesar = awesome. Pizzas: margarita was top notch, calabrese wowwww even got a vegan to try and was definitely not upset she ate the sausage. Zucchini pizza was fantastic also.  Nowwww the pastas!!! Again we are Italians we make our own pasta this was unreal.  Tagliatelle Bolognese some said was their favorite, others said the rock shrimp pasta with corn was theirs . Then we got the buccatini with guancele...game changer. Deserts? Yes please unreal like we made our own...  Again we don't give out this rating for Italian food this easily, in fact we never eat Italian out because we're disappointed that we could make it better at home. Nope not this time....we will be back and you are insane if you don't consider going here as a top choice in Boston</td>\n",

Your overpriced sushi taste similar or worst than a cheap supermarket sushi. You should change your chef, because he/she obviously doesn't know what the real sushi taste like. I would never mind paying the  fancy price for a good food, but let's face the fact that your food doesn't deserve the price. I've been to many upscale sushi restaurants around the world, noting taste as awful as your sushi, especially for the price, 3 rolls + miso soup for $120.. Ridiculous for the quality. I would not pay $5 for your sushi, if I only knew it would be this awful\\nName: Gogo Ya; Review: For Boston, this is top rate Sushi\\nName: Symphony Sushi; Review: Every time I go to a new restaurant, I try to find the menu item that'll be my go-to in the future. Symphony Sushi is very close to where I live, and it has been for years now, so of course it has preference over other sushi places for that reason. Time and time again I've tried to find something, anything on the menu that I think is actually worth ordering again. I haven't found a single thing. I've ordered something different almost every time I've gone, and nothing has taken my heart. Everything has been perfectly mediocre. I hate to talk about my exes, but back in Albany I had a sushi place called Sushi Tei that I was absolutely smitten with. The prices were good, and the sushi was so tasty it was unreal. But Albany isn't known for its sushi, so I figured a city like Boston would have its standards a lot higher, right? Symphony Sushi hasn't given me anything that's measured up, despite my many attempts to give it another chance. If you're just craving sushi in general and you're local like I am, this is your place. But if you want something with more substance, something that'll actually wow you, you'll have to look elsewhere. I'm sorry. :</td>\n",

There are some kinds of Sake and Japanese beer, other than the usual ones. In the menu I only looked for sushi-style food, there are sushi, rolls, maki and sashimi among others.  I chose some with tuna, salmon and yellowfish, and they were very fresh and tasty. It's not the best sushi I've ever had, but it was really good, it was prepared when ordered.  The wasabi was also very good, it mixed really well with the soy sauce and the flavour was awesome, very spicy tho.

But I’ve also tried some of their Mexican dishes, I’d say their Mexican dishes are not typical Mexican food it’s more like Taco Bell. However, this is a great restaurant to take your family. Great service, the ladies are always polite and attentive. I wish I could give 5 stars but you guys need to improve on your Mexican dishes. I do recommend this restaurant\\nName: Casa Romero; Review: Came here for a very early dinner around 5 PM on a Sunday. This place is accessible via an alley and the first thing you noticed the beautiful door. You walk downstairs to a heavily-decorated Mexican restaurant with all the decor from Mexico. It has a very traditional Mexican restaurant feel.  FOOD: Seemed to be a little bit more authentic than your average Mexican food restaurant. We realized that since we arrived before 6 and would leave by 7 that we could order the early bird special which has 3 courses for $24. I was hungry so I went for it.  Marinated Chicken Wings with Mole Sauce - These chicken wings were on the fattier side but the sauce was rich and delicious. This also came with fried plantains on top which was a nice sweet element. I LOVE fried plantains.  Pulled Roasted Pork (aka Cochinita Pibil) - SO delicious. Perfect balance of a little spicy with very savory. The meat was so tender. I wish I could have eaten this all night.  Mexican-Style Crepes - not sure what makes this Mexican besides the caramel on top but this is also filled with sliced bananas. Came with a side of vanilla ice cream. Delicious and wish I had more.  Portions were on the smaller side compared to other Mexican restaurants, though that may have been because it was part of the early bird special. I would definitely come back for the early bird special.  Tip: If you order before 6 and leave before 7, get the early bird special. $24 for 3 courses. What a deal! Keep that in mind if you are hungry one afternoon in Back Bay\\nName: Burro Bar South End; Review: Came here with a group of 7 friends on a Friday night without reservations. They have a big bar as well as a lounge area that is first come first served so if you don't have a reservation, you can still get a seat relatively quickly if are lucky.  AMBIANCE: very lively, one of the most fun nights I've had in Boston.  SERVICE: pretty good, they accidentally brought us 2 Mexican Ice Cream Sundaes and gave us the second one for free so that was a nice plus.  FOOD: not too big of a menu for a Mexican restaurant but it has something for everyone. My friends seemed to like their kale salad and short rib tacos (the latter of which did seem small for $7) but I had the street cart chicken, one of my favorite things to get at Mexican restaurants. It's a well-cooked, well-spiced half chicken with Mexican rice and fried plantains. Hearty and filling, a nice balance of sweet and spicy.  For dessert, we had the Mexican Ice Cream Sundae which was my favorite thing we got. Three different ice creams: chipotle chocolate, coconut avocado, and dulce de leche. Then it's topped with horchata whipped cream, Marcona almonds, caramelized plantains, and tequila soaked cherries. I could have eaten this whole thing by myself but unfortunately I had to share.  Overall, burro bar was great for a casual night out with friends but I definitely want to try and check out some other South End restaurants before coming bac\\nName: Tenoch Mexican; Review: I want places that attempt to be real Mexican food to survive in Boston, so I'm rating Tenoch a little higher than it deserves. This is about as close to authentic as I've seen in Boston, but it still leaves something to be desired. I'm a greasy sandwich junkie, so tortas are one of my favorite Mexican foods. This torta was OK. All the toppings were there, but the meat wasn't well seasoned and the telera bread was limp without the crunch it should have on the outside. I'll go again because there's nowhere for a torta fix—until I leave the Mexican food desert that is the Northeast\\nName: El Pelón Taqueria; Review: This place was a HAVEN in a Mexican-food desert in Boston. I tried so hard to find Mexican food comparable to what I'm used to as a native Texan, and trust me - there were a lot of failures. I brought my brother to this place as a break from his first year of college, and was pleasantly surprised that it was tiny, but packed!! The smell was INTOXICATING, and I could barely wait to order!! The choice was easy to make - El Guapo all the way. Plantains inside of a burrito? GENIUS. The best part was that the fried plantains just elevated the flavor of an already amazing burrito - the grilled steak, mexican rice, black beans, salsa, lettuce, and crema were perfectly en pointe. And the wait was short, even with a long line!  I've trekked out here in rain, snow, busy days after work - it's worth it! While the food is super authentic, the decor is really eclectic and cozy - there's so much to look at! The whole history of the place is written on the walls and is a great conversation starter.  I dream of coming back, and I highly recommend! Super affordable, excellent Mexican food</td>\n",

       "      <td>Name: Casa Romero; Review: Came here for a very early dinner around 5 PM on a Sunday. This place is accessible via an alley and the first thing you noticed the beautiful door. You walk downstairs to a heavily-decorated Mexican restaurant with all the decor from Mexico. It has a very traditional Mexican restaurant feel.  FOOD: Seemed to be a little bit more authentic than your average Mexican food restaurant. We realized that since we arrived before 6 and would leave by 7 that we could order the early bird special which has 3 courses for $24. I was hungry so I went for it.  Marinated Chicken Wings with Mole Sauce - These chicken wings were on the fattier side but the sauce was rich and delicious. This also came with fried plantains on top which was a nice sweet element. I LOVE fried plantains.  Pulled Roasted Pork (aka Cochinita Pibil) - SO delicious. Perfect balance of a little spicy with very savory. The meat was so tender. I wish I could have eaten this all night.  Mexican-Style Crepes - not sure what makes this Mexican besides the caramel on top but this is also filled with sliced bananas. Came with a side of vanilla ice cream. Delicious and wish I had more.  Portions were on the smaller side compared to other Mexican restaurants, though that may have been because it was part of the early bird special. I would definitely come back for the early bird special.  Tip: If you order before 6 and leave before 7, get the early bird special. $24 for 3 courses. What a deal! Keep that in mind if you are hungry one afternoon in Back Bay\\n\\nName: Herrera's Mexican Grill; Review: Visiting Boston, MA for the first time. Asked locals what to check out- they recommended this. So glad they did! The food is fresh and the line was out the door. I ordered tacos. Delicious. My dad ordered an enchilada- I tasted it- the best enchilada I've ever had. Also- they have plenty of salsas to choose from\\n\\nName: La Hacienda; Review: My family and I are from Texas where Mexican restaurants are a staple. We recently moved to the Boston area and have been searching for good Mexican, or Latin food type of restaurant. I found this place on Google maps and saw that it had nearly 1200 reviews and a rating of 4.5 stars. So I took my family to this place on a Saturday night with high hopes. We first walked in and stood at the hostess podium waiting for a few minutes for someone to greet then sit us. After a couple of minutes a staff member walked up, gave a half smile to us and walked away without saying anything. Finally a middle aged gentleman came and sat us. A server finally came by out table to ask what we wanted to drink and dropped off the chips and salsa. The server wasnt very friendly, she didnt offer to tell us anything about the restaurant or the menu. We ordered a couple of margaritas from their drink menu. While waiting for the drinks I tried the chips and salsa. My god I've never seen salsa with so many chunks of white onion. The Salsa literally was chunks of white onion and tomato sauce. The chips were stale. Got out margaritas. Not impressed. They tasted like like juice, soap water, and cheap tequila. The children's menu only offers, hot dogs, cheese burger and chicken fingers or wings... what kind of mexican restaurant doesnt offer any type of mexican dish on their Children's menu? I had to pay $9.00 for a cheese quesadilla off the regular menu for my daughter. It was so disgusting that she wouldn't even eat it.. and this girl loves cheese. Our server never came back by to check on us, or ask us if we would like another drink.  Although she came by once after my wife's food was dropped off to ask us how our meals were. Only problem is that my daughter and I were still waiting to receive our food. She was completely oblivious to the fact that there were no plates of food in front of us. I guess that worked better because if she would have asked us when we actually had our food, then I would have told her it was no better than \"ok\". We had to litterally ask another server to help us. If you are looking for a good experience or even just decent food... try else where. I miss Papasitos and Uncle Julios back in Texas\\n\\nName: Mexicali Sushi Bar; Review: Mexican style sushi, I get the chance to try the “Chiles Güeros” (Caribbean peppers stuffed with cream cheese and shrimp wrapped in bacon)... they were for lack of a better word were just perfect! Then I had the seafood tower and the aguachile shrimp.. both excellent! But my favorite of the night was the Mexicali sushi roll! All around everything was super good plus the hibiscus water and the cucumber water were legit like if you had ordered one from the “michoacana” (Mexican juice stop). Definitely coming back very very soon\\n\\nName: Tavitas Mexican; Review: Do not call this Tex-Mex or Mexican! The cheese for the tortilla chips (cardboard and tasteless) came as a greasy hard block of something that resembled something of a mozzarella/white American cheese blend you might find on a bad pizza. Not  anywhere close to a Mexican ques . Should not be served anywhere. The chimichanga was greasy ground beef with questionable vegetables and strange seasonings. The dough was tough, tasteless and soggy in the middle. After spending 15 years in Houston and trying all kinds of tex-mex, this was by far the very worst. SOOOO disappointing! Has the chef and cooking staff ever tried good tex-mex? This really isnt a matter of preference in prep or seasoning, it just us really not tex-mex at all! On a crazy side note...why is there rap music being played in a Mexican restaurant? Seriously?? Ugh</td>\n",

The chef here really knows what she wants the guest to experience and she makes it happen\\nName: House of Siam; Review: I've been here a number of times, one of them being for an anniversary dinner, and it seriously fits all of my needs. It's classy enough that you can bring someone on a date, yet casual enough that you can head there after work when you're just hankering for some thai food. The really attentive staff and super good food will keep me coming here for a long, long time\\nName: Mastro's Ocean Club; Review: We were six people celebrating an anniversary. There were no champagne flutes available. They brought over a bread basket with two rolls for six people. It was so noisy you could not speak to the person directly next to you.  The Halibut came out overcooked and when  told about it it was sent back and I was told to eat  the sides while waiting. I told the others to eat while their meals were still hot and by the time the second piece of fish arrived (not properly cooked either),everyone had finished their meals and the sides wire cold. We had to remove plates and glasses so that we had room on the table and we put them on the floor.  When the manager (Peter) was told about it he brought over a horrible bottle of dessert wine and a tray of desserts on the house. Once that was done they forgot that we were celebrating an anniversary. Peter, the manager who was on that evening was not responsive when I called and left a message several times after we left the restaurant. Boston has many fine restaurants - I would never go back and spend money at this one. They lost six good customers\\nName: Lolita Back Bay; Review: My girlfriend and I came here for our 5th anniversary, an we were not disappointed in the slightest. Lengthy review ahead, because I truly enjoyed my experience here.  When I made the reservation, I noted that it was our anniversary and that, if possible, I'd like to have flowers waiting at the table ahead of time. As it turns out, the tables have flowers (real roses, too) by default. Along with beautiful silverware and plates. We were sat and our server wished us a happy anniversary, which I did not expect; so that was quite a nice little touch.  The meal began with a complementary grapefruit-tequila palette cleanser, which was very nice and unexpected. The shot of tequila that went in it was free as well! I thought this may have been a perk of it being our anniversary, but it turns out that every table gets this as well!  We split a pitcher of the Diablo margarita, which was the perfect blend of spicy, sweet, and tequila-y; I definitely recommend. We were each able to have several glasses of it, making it quite a fair price. The glasses were rimmed a lightly spiced sugar, along with lime and pepper slices.  Chips and salsa/dip are also complimentary here. The chips, seemingly homemade, were great; not too salty, not oily at all. The salsas/dip were a delicious spicy verde salsa, a nice, mild, tomato-y dip and some kind of chipotle aioli thing (I'm not a fan of sour cream/mayo based dips, so I didn't try it so I don't know actually know what it was). The verde was to die for, though!  We each got an app. She ordered the Guac Fresca, which she said was the creamiest, most amazing guac she's ever had. I ordered the empanadas, which were great. They were certainly nothing too unique, but were very well done and I enjoyed them for sure.  As for mains, I ordered the Carne Asada and she the Cauliflower Tacos. My steak, while rather small, was impeccable. Perfectly tendered, subtly charred, and oh so flavorful. I was initially disappointed by the size, but it more than made up for it in flavor and texture. The cauliflower tacos were amazing, as well. They managed to pack lots of different flavors and textures into these tacos, but nothing overpowered the other. Also, the cauliflower was fried to perfection with a nice thing, crunchy coating. The cauliflower in those tacos could be made into an app by itself.  We decided not to order dessert, as we had things waiting for us at home (and we were pretty stuffed), but we received yet ANOTHER complementary item, sour-apple cotton candy. Every table received this after their meal, but in ours, they stuck three beautiful roses into it, yet another unexpected, lovely detail. I didn't specifically ask for this, so they took it upon themselves to do this for us.  As for the restaurant itself, it's really something unique. The setting is ultra-gothic, quite dark, and definitely not something you see in a restaurant. The gothic theme did give it a certain romance, but that was diluted somewhat by the volume of the crowd and the London-bar-esque music. Ultimately we could have chosen a more romantic setting for our anniversary, but this was certainly an amazing experience and I regret nothing.  Oh and our server was very courteous and very prompt, but never pushy. A+ to her.  Come here with friends, family, a loved one, or by yourself and grab a drink at the bar. It's a very interesting, unique location perfect for a night out. It's not exactly kid or elderly friendly, so keep that in mind\\nName: Gaslight; Review: We come here for our anniversary, and the service we receive is enough to keep us coming back every year.  I just add a little note notifying them of the occasion, and the entire staff seemed to know (in a positive way).  What blew my mind was when we arrived, without a word to the bartender, they directed us to the bar to wait for our table.  The bartender already knew who we were and handed us two glasses of champagne and wished us a happy anniversary with a smile.  This really impressed me, it was so seamless.  After a short while they brought us to the table.  The waiters we have had are always some of the best I have had in Boston, although we admittedly do not dine out like this very often.  The food is always amazing.  French onion soup split for 2 is the way to go every time.  In recent times we have had the steak, the duck, and the mussles.  All were fantastic.  Sitting outside on a nice evening is wonderful as well, as long as it is decently warm.  (they do have heaters!)  This is a great spot for a special occasion!!</td>\n",

The other two 1st floor dining rooms (beautiful, historic) were closed for the night, likely because it was a slow Monday evening. Rock music was playing.

They have steaks and seafood and I believe possibly lamb. Food was delicious but some items were expensive the steak was expensive and it was just the steak no sides came with it. Side dishes which are good enough to share with least one other person sometimes they don't tell you that and so you end up with a lot of leftovers for the appetizers. Butterscotch bread pudding was very good the lemon sorbet was actually lemon sherbert but still was refreshing after a nice meal and the service was very good they were very attentive. it is a very nice atmosphere. It's not a chain restaurant so you get the feeling of it being a little bit more romantic get a little bit dressed up so you can have a nice evening out</td>\n",

We were promptly seated at what seemed an especially nice table for 2 with large wingback chairs.  Alas, these big comfy chairs aren’t so well suited to eating; we had to sit up on the edges to eat.  Nothing came to the table for a bit, but then a friendly waiter greeted us with \"welcome back.\"  (Did someone really track that we had eaten there a few years ago?).  We ordered drinks, and our meal.  We were seated a full 45 minutes before our first course came. My wife loved her foie gras; my burrata was a somewhat odd presentation; it was submerged in \"tomato water,\" something not mentioned on the menu, and making it something of a cold soup.  I wouldn’t get it again.  Main courses arrived promptly after that, but our waiter forgot that I had suggested we might like a glass of wine with dinner.  Indeed, where was our waiter?  I asked the server to bring back the wine list; the wines actually arrived when we were a third through our main courses.  My wife’s salmon was terrific; it was very lightly cooked, and she couldn’t finish it, even with help from me.  My rib-eye steak was cooked perfectly, and it was tasty, but didn’t look the least bit like a rib-eye.  It looked like a large cube of sirloin, with little, if any, marbling.  We got dessert menus, and then, we lost our waiter again.  We had to grab the roving hostess to get him to return to the table.  The Dark Chocolate Crèmeux was a memorable dessert.  Great chocolate, and lots of different textures.  As others have noted, this is not an inexpensive restaurant, and while it had several big pluses, the more-than-occasional lapses in service and presentation weren’t up to this high a price tag</td>\n",

Maybe it was a mistake ordering seafood at a steakhouse but my halibut came out dry as a bone. They offer pan seared, grilled or baked. I figured panseared would be the best option for keeping the fish moist and flavorful. Boy was I wrong! It appeared like they baked it from the looks of it. My husband ordered 8oz filet medium rare. It came out medium well. The sides were good and our app of tuna tartare was good too.

We finished with their 10-layer chocolate cake, which we were not able to finish by any means (who doesn't love dessert leftovers?), along with coffee. - The manager has a great dry sense of humor :)  CONS (more of a pro-tip): - We were originally seated in the \"main dining room,\" which was really just an extension of the bar/lounge. The other two 1st floor dining rooms (beautiful, historic) were closed for the night, likely because it was a slow Monday evening. Rock music was playing. Better to go on a weekend evening when the other dining rooms are open. Ask to reserve a table in \"The Library Room,\" where you can see beautiful, timeless pieces of America's history all around you as you eat--original flags from before we had 50 states, original hand-painted map of Boston, engraved crown molding with Generals from U.S. battles dating back to 1776!  Pro-tip TD;LR: Worth going regardless of day/time if you want to just enjoy a casual night of steaks, but only go on weekends when they are busy if you want to enjoy a fancier, or more history-filled dinner\\n\\nName: Piccolo Nido; Review: After having a  few pleasant dinners at Piccolo Nido, we decided to celebrate our daughter's engagement there. It was one of the worst and most embarrassing dinners we have ever had at a restaurant. We had reservations and arrived on time, we were one of the first parties there. As the restaurant filled with patrons the service, at our table of 10, the wait staff became less and less attentive. EVERYONE at the restaurant was served their dinner before us. We waited 2 hours before our dinner was served. When I asked why everyone else was already served, the owner, Pino, came to the table and in a very rude way (so that everyone could hear) said that they don't usually accomodate parties of 10, (then why did they take a reservation for a party of 10?) and that there were people with children who had come in after us, (so were we to wait because people come in with kids, not my problem!) so naturally they would be served first. We will NEVER return to Piccolo Nido again. Worst dining experience ever! Food was average by the way. Much better restaurants in the North End\\n\\nName: Gaslight; Review: We come here for our anniversary, and the service we receive is enough to keep us coming back every year.  I just add a little note notifying them of the occasion, and the entire staff seemed to know (in a positive way).  What blew my mind was when we arrived, without a word to the bartender, they directed us to the bar to wait for our table.  The bartender already knew who we were and handed us two glasses of champagne and wished us a happy anniversary with a smile.  This really impressed me, it was so seamless.  After a short while they brought us to the table.  The waiters we have had are always some of the best I have had in Boston, although we admittedly do not dine out like this very often.  The food is always amazing.  French onion soup split for 2 is the way to go every time.  In recent times we have had the steak, the duck, and the mussles.  All were fantastic.  Sitting outside on a nice evening is wonderful as well, as long as it is decently warm.  (they do have heaters!)  This is a great spot for a special occasion!!</td>\n",

The big bartender was an jerk right away. As we sat he proceeded give our group a hard time and call us names in Italian, including racial insults. Little did he know that one of our group spoke Italian and called him out on it. We decided to leave and asked for the check, he placed the check far from my reach so when I went to grab it I accidentally tipped my glass. I was able to catch my glass there was a small spill. As I tried to clean it up with my napkin he swatted my hand away and took my unfinished glass of wine. I apologized for the accident with, I am sorry to only be told in return not as sorry as he was. No pizza or wine is worth this rude behavior. especially with other pizza shops down the road\\nName: Kung Fu Tea; Review: UPDATE : my friends drinks were all made incorrectly and they had ordered some to go and still messed it up. Worst experience we travel an hour away to this place. Never going back.  Me and my small group of friends visited this place, and we asked if they were closed and the employee said no. (We asked because they were closing in a few minutes) so I’m the last person in line to put in my order and he says he can’t take my order because it was already 11 so they’re technically “closed”. My friends ordered their drinks and I was left with nothing. We should’ve asked for a refund and left, but I was so annoyed I couldn’t think. If I could give no stars as a review I would. First time there and never going back.  I’m seriously frustrated and I want to contact cooperate\\nName: Audubon; Review: This is a shout out mostly to Jay, the host, and the fantastic waitstaff we had a few nights ago. The food's also great, of course, but we had nine people on a group outing during a freezing night, which is asking a bit much of such a cozy (small) place.  No reservations allowed, but we were on the wait list. Unfortunately, horrible traffic for a local event (ski jumping inside Fenway Park of all things) delayed most of the group well beyond the time Jay could reasonably hold our tables. He would have been completely right to send us on our way, but instead, when a sizable group deserted the long, thin high top table separating the entry from the bar, he sat those of us who had arrived and reserved the rest of the space for our group.  Thanks again for helping salvage our evening\\nName: Dillon's; Review: TL;DR Awful, disrespectful service. Called ahead to secure a space for a large group and we were ignored, treated like a nuisance, and basically made clear we were not wanted. None of us are going back.  Full (Long) Story I work at a store nearby of about 250 employees. We will occasionally have gatherings at local spots to celebrate birthdays, promotions, just general fun.  A friend was having a birthday and called about a week ahead to see if DIllons could accommodate a large-ish group of about 30, with folks coming and going throughout the night. She tried to book the place for a Friday night, so she knew it may be busy and wanted to make sure this could work. They said this was fine.  When my group arrived after our shift, a few folks had already shown up early. They got a table on the patio but when we tried to join them, they warned us that they had been told we’d all get thrown out of too many of us tried to sit on the patio.  So the rest of us decide to go to the bar. Their front bar is not super large, so this ended up being a disaster and it took close to 20 minutes for the first of us to get a drink. By this point the birthday girl showed up and was trying to secure us a space.  They decided to stick us on these tables towards the back; not the back room but rather ones that line the hall to get to the back. The tables could fit maybe 8 people comfortably and anybody standing was blocking the hall to get to the back.  Another group had been giving that room. We were told if we wanted table service one person would have to put down a credit card to assure payment. With us expecting upwards of 50 people coming and going through the night, we obviously weren’t going to do that, but we were not getting service at the bar.  Once the group who had the back space showed up, it was a miserable, cramped mess. It was obvious the staff didn’t want us there. I ended up leaving, having never gotten a drink.  After the fact the rest of our group left and went to another spot nearby who’s always accommodated us happily, knew us well and had no issue with the large, transient group.  Needless to say, never going back, and our staff of 250+ people all heard about how we were treated and take their business elsewhere as well\\nName: Mariel; Review: If able, I wouldn't even give them that 1 star, they deserve 0. Yes, I do not write many reviews, thats because most restaurants I eat at are consistently good, so I never felt the need to review. But this place I couldn't not share this experience. This place just opened, they should've saved the money spent on cheesy chandeliers and decor and bought some decent food to serve(since at the end of the day people come to EAT) and a better, much more professional staff, from the manager down. Or just made it a Taco Bell, which serves better food and even provides better service. We were celebrating my wife's 40th birthday with 3 couples, SIX PEOPLE,  three course meal, so we obviously ordered SEVERAL appetizers, 6 entrees and 6 deserts, making this an accurate variety of menu review. One word: HORRIBLE!! I actually felt so bad that this was my suggestion since it was new, obviously none of our group had ever been and my wife loves trying new restaurants throughout Boston. I saw it just opened and all their advertising, so I thought it would be a nice surprise just like by inviting her 2 best friends and their husbands to join us. How bad did I feel?? Bad enough that the following Sat night I took the same group (all SIX OF US) out to a good restaurant for the experience my wife deserved originally. Not to mention it cost me 2 group dinners! Literally not ONE person left Mariel ever wanting to return. We were all VERY DISAPPOINTED. Tiny portions of sub par food, more like half orders at other places. It was a mostly bare plate. I didn't take pics but noticed others had, so you can see for yourself</td>\n",

There was a long delay between the point we were ready to order and the point the waitress came to take our orders. Everyone said they enjoyed their plentiful meals, and they were quick to respond with extras we requested. We agreed we would eat here again\\nName: The Social Register; Review: High prices, small portions, and ok food. I visited with a group of 4. The menu suggested that patrons order with the intent to share each dish. We decided to follow the suggestion and each ordered a different item. When the food finally arrived (service was very slow this night, though the table clearing girls were extremely fastidious), we were very disappointed to find that the portions were more suited for 1-2 people. Even more boggling was that dishes were divided into 3 or 5 pieces, clearly the perfect choice for a 'shareable' dish. If this was called out in the menu we would have known and not ordered. For example, the shareable Caeser salad was served in a bowl the size of a normal cereal bowl, thus not nearly enough. If my group was 1 or 2 people, such as a date, 4 dishes would have been enough to satisfy us. With 4 people, 4 dishes just didn't cut it. We found out later by watching other patrons, that ordering burgers or sandwiches was the way to go. Those dishes came out on large plates with heaping helpings of fries along with a large burger. All that for about the same price as any one of the tiny dishes we ordered! Unfortunately we had already spent over $60 on our tiny plates and decided to cut our losses and leave. The server could tell we were unsatisfied with the meal and apologized. We told her that it was mostly the tiny amount of food that made us upset, but the slow service didn't help. The atmosphere was loud and for some reason everything was brass colored. It almost looked like they were going for a steampunk vibe but forgot all the interesting machinery bits. Very blah and dark. So to sum this up, get a burger here if you want a decent amount of food. If you would rather waste your money on small amounts of mediocre food then get the 'social' dishes\\nName: Cafeteria Boston; Review: Cafeteria Boston is one of my favorite restaurants in the city. And just like any other restaurant that I love, I've dined here several times and they NEVER disappoint.  The last time I went here was in late August with three friends. The weather was gorgeous, sunny and warm, versus hot and humid so of course we sat on the patio. Since it was early evening (sometime between 4 and 5pm)  the patio was mostly empty around that time. Upon arrival, it was only myself and my friend that drove us, so we were waiting on our two other friends. Although everyone arrived at different intervals in time, our server was still prompt and checked in with us regularly.  I'm the definition of a social drinker so I ordered one fruity cocktail, the pomegranate martini; then I had the chicken drumsticks with celery and carrot sticks (ALL the sticks) as an appetizer. Soon after our other two friends arrived and so did the rest of Boston as the patio started to fill up quickly.  I was having such a great time catching up with everyone I didn't even notice if there was a lapse between our drinks and food as we dined for several hours. I got the black bean burger as my entree and devoured it and everyone else was super happy with their entree choices as well.  The food and service here are always good will definitely be back soon\\nName: Marlborough Super Buffet; Review: I must say that this is a fun place for a group of people. The food at this place is consistently pretty okay. The food is best around the noon lunch rush and the 6-7pm dinner rush as the options are refreshed regularly.  There are a ton of options to choose from. As with typical Americanized Asian food offerings, you'll find the standard options like spare ribs, chicken with broccoli, rice options, and chicken fingers plus wontons, soup, crawfish and more. Additionally, the dinner menu comes with an option for the hand made sushi that's pretty good!  They're are also options for the fussy eating underage crowd: chicken tenders, pizza, french fries and the like.  It's not fine dining, but it's a great place for a good meal\\nName: Belly Buster Diner; Review: Came here yesterday with my daughter and a friend, it was our first time and I've heard great things about this place. The food is amazing!! I got a veggie omelette and it was huge. I couldn't even finish everything on my plate because the portions are so big.

Almost a homely and comfortable feel. Food is varied, generous, ..and absolutely delicious!! Great oxtail, goat meat, jerk, fish steaks. Oh yes, the beef patty, a must try. The cod fritter is great too. Get the rice with beans, and sure, for sure, the cabbage and carrots! And the jerk wings?!!! God, where do I stop?!!  When you walk through the door u see that they were Zagat rated. When the food is in your mouth , you will know that they deserve.  Good food in that neighborhood is mostly subs and pizzas. In the midst of that, they are heaven.  Only, they are a little fussy about 'dine in'. You have to make up your mind, are you \"taking out\" or dining in? They look more like a deli, but don't like you buying a box and sit down to eat from it, if you felt like! So if you want to dine in, please sit down and wait to be table service :). By the way, they stop dine in at least 30min before the restaurant closing, while you can continue to buy carry out\\n\\nName: Barracuda on the Fly; Review: Friendly staff at clean location with ~20ppl worth of seating.

Not for a long stay as it seems that they do not have a bathroom for customer. Good spot for quick lunch\\n\\nName: Ocean Prime; Review: If you are looking for fine dining in downtown Boston, this is definitely the place, chain or no chain. This is going to give Grill 23, Capital Grille and Ruth Chris Steak House a run for their money, which the latter two are chains as well. First off, the location absolutely hits the mark and is in the center of the action. This sits in a central spot directly at the beginning of the seaport district. The valet parking is a bit tight seeing this is a busy street, however they are quick on their feet and even send you an automated text when the car is being delivered.  The interior of this place is quite large and you would never know it from the street. The bar area is beautiful and the whole place is elegantly decorated and looks really cool and trendy. The bar serves up some creative cocktails, even a really cool berry concoction with dry ice that tasted excellent. We got their a bit early and our Saturday reservation was not until 8:30pm so we sat in the bar. The place was very crowded and the hostess station was a bit disorganized. We did not get seated until around 8:45pm since they were waiting on tables to clear but with 3 hostesses, thats how busy this place was on Saturday night.  We were seated in a back room area which was nicely secluded and the main dining room is split up into multiple rooms. The staff here is so good, they attend to you right away and are there throughout every step of the meal which was nice. The menu is large with not only more cocktails, appetizers, sushi, seafood and of course steak done many different ways. We opted for appetizers of goat cheese ravioli, deviled eggs with caviar and steak tartar which all were incredible. The goat cheese ravioli melted in your mouth. For entrees, we ordered filets, scallops and a surf and turf with sides of smoked gouda tater tots (just delicious) and some sautéed brussel sprouts. Every bite was tender, cooked to perfection and tasted beautiful. I have eaten at Capital Grille many times as well as Abe and Louies and this steak blew them out of the water.  For dessert we were about to order when an older gentleman from another table came over and told us we were being too loud which was probably one of the rudest things that could happen during a night out, of which we let him know before he left. Our waiter overheard the exchange and offered up free dessert of a 10 layer carrot cake (yes 10), chocolate covered peanut butter cake and a brownie batter ice cream which again all hit the spot, delicious. This meal was very good and I would highly recommend this place. Prices are what you would expect for fine dining and it was worth every penny\\n\\nName: Real Deal, LLC; Review: Covid helpful info: parallel street parking, no meters. Most times of the day you can find a spot near this location. Once you walk into the joint you will go to the cashier to get your food. They have 2-3 tables inside but not sure if you can dine in there. No tables to dine out, it is mostly a location people do take out or delivery from.  This location is a local favorite for me. I used to live near the Cleveland Circle location, hang out with friends near the JP one, and now I live by the West Roxbury location and I love them all equally. Their food is consistent and they are always quick. My favorite app that I get almost every time is their onion rings because they are really yummy but I am a big fan of sauces and their kickin bayou sauce is delicious! The sauce is like a sriracha, Mayo, and other yummy things (real deal sorry if I’m wrong with those ingredients!) Meals I typically get are the Joe Spa (chicken Caesar wrap), Reuben, grown up grilled cheese, any burger, and any pizza. Definitely would recommend going to any of their locations</td>\n",

HIGHLY RECOMMEND Fenway Johnnie's - it re-opened this week - after 4 months shuttered - and I couldn't wait to get back. I always feel welcomed here.  LOCATION: Only steps from Fenway Park, here you can get real food before or after a Red Sox Game. Great lounge atmosphere plus bar seating with some good seating in the additional dining room. Lots of big TVs, sports posters and artwork surround the rooms. Not just bar food, but a choice of entrees make Johnnie's a little different, and a little better than neighboring restaurants.  FOOD: Probably the best tasting salmon dinner I have had in a long while.  Preparation is key, and this entree was done right - not hard or over-cooked - this Pan seared salmon came with Lyonnaise potatoes, and green beans served with a great lemon beurre-blanc sauce. Delicious!  DRINKS:  Best beer and liquor selection - a full bar - with bartenders who know how to make a great cocktail. Igor and Dana stand out.  FAMILY:  Johnnie's is large enough to bring your family or friends for a get-together near Fenway Park. The tables are big, with enough room for everyone. Best yet, you will always be treated like family here  - from  the Johnnie's  family. Treat yourself and family to some of the best restaurant service in Boston - friendly, professional and sharp.

They also have great service for people who come to the restaurant. Lastly, the seating area where you eat is entertaining and comfortable.  I like the 99 because they have great food.I love their ribs because they are juicy and tender. The macaroni and cheese is delightful. It is always hot and cheesy. Are you a big baseball fan? If so, when the Red Sox win kids eat for free. Great news grown ups, you don't have to pay  They have drinks that no one can live without. The pink lemonade is awesome. It is really refreshing to drink. You can get as many free refills as you want. You can also ask for a different drink.  They even have root beer that taste like icecream. With so many options, you won't have a problem finding a drink that you like.  The waitresses are nice and give good service. Before you order they give you popcorn. If you are very hungry then eat some popcorn,  but warning do not spoil your dinner. They bring out the food fast and make sure you have everything you need at the table. At the end, they give the kids an ice cream sandwich.  Lastly, I like the 99 because of the seating area the chairs are comfortable and fluffy. You can watch any kind of sports games. They have Celtics Pictures on the the wall. If you get bored then watch tv and eat more popcorn.  I hope you visit the 99 and experience the food and drinks, the service,  and the seating area that I love about the restaurant.

Finally gave it a try as part of our try something new in the area. We went for lunch on Saturday at 12:30. The parking lot is full as there was a baby shower going on in the function room. It pretty decent American style with a good mix of classic and new dishes. We ordered veritirs of dishes, Fish Chowder, BBQ Ribs, Baked Haddock , Roasted Lamb, for us, and pasta and chicken fingers for kids. The chowder had a hearty taste, good for a cold day. The ribs were St Louis style, fall of the bone tender. The baked haddock was very tender, the light touch of butter made the fish very smooth. The baked lamb is tomato based, it could use a kick of flavor. Kids meals are large potion and pretty standard. Overall, pretty nice place, would come again.

I promise you all 50 of us raved about the food! Fried chicken sooo good! Mac and cheese sooo good! BBQ pulled pork, bomb too! Oh and the jerk chicken was yummy too! The food your restaurant provided was exceptional! Looking forward to visiting the restaurant on my own\\n\\nName: Tony C’s Seaport; Review: If I could give 0 stars I would. We were staying in the hotel right next door and were looking for a family friendly restaurants as we had three kids with us. There was nobody waiting outside so we thought we would get right in. We walked in, the host took a second to look around (at the plenty of empty tables) and then told us there were 3 or 4 groups ahead of us and there would be a wait. I asked about how long, and he couldn’t give me an answer, just 3 or 4 groups. Don’t you know as a host how many people are waiting? I feel they did not want the children in there and it was very unprofessional and we felt unwelcome. We ended up at the restaurant right across the way and witnessed several people walk in and be seated immediately the entire time we were dining. Would definitely not recommend!! Don’t say you are a family friendly restaurant when you steer families away\\n\\nName: Little Asia Restaurant; Review: The place is great for a family or if you just need a quick bite and a beer. Their food is always a top go to but a secret weapon of theirs is the chinese pizza. I'm not sure it's on their online menu but just ask, they're awesome. The staff has always been very friendly, they get to know you quick and treat you like you've been going forever. Now with Covid they have barriers between tables and seem to be taking the situation seriously. They have a bar area and a variety of drinks (man's mai tai is always my go to), keno if you want to kill time while waiting. Would definitely suggest trying if you haven'\\n\\nName: Sportello; Review: CHILD FRIENDLY! Can't say enough about this place.  Hadn't been in a couple years and wasn't sure what to expect. My 3yr old was tantruming as we walked in and multiple staff immediately came over to offer bread, suggest firing a child's pasta dish, and bring a coloring book with crayons. Server mentioned dessert without saying the word and told me I didn't need to apologize for my son.  And when I asked for an espresso before leaving it arrived within a 2 minutes. Arguably best service I've ever had.  The food was awesome.  Octopus carpaccio was inventive and delicious (and portion was almost a meal in itself). The shrimp and corn cappaletti was good and creative,  although I didn't love that the filling was a mousse. Dish was well executed though.  My son's tagliatelle with butter was beautiful. Tagliatelle was so delicate and the butter was more of a butter emulsion\\n\\nName: Roza Lyons; Review: Great place to bring the family for a meal or a couple friends for drinks.  The staff is very friendly and accommodating.   The menu is diverse so there is something for everyone and they have several weekly specials so it doesn't get boring.  We mostly enjoy the friendly atmosphere</td>\n",
       "      <td>Name: Liberty Diner; Review: Absolutely the atmosphere I was looking for. Very local, multicultural feel. The menu was exactly what you would expect from a local dinner, and the food was excellent. I went simple and got a cheeseburger and fries, but the burger was delicious, and the fries weren't greasy. The cost for my entire meal and tip was $12. I'd absolutely recommend this place for a comfortable, quick, familiar bite to eat\\n\\nName: FiRE+iCE; Review: Be prepared for the amazing Fire and Ice in Back Bay which is very close to shopping stores. My favorite food is the Alfredo spaghetti with shrimp. I think you might like it as much as I do. You should try it and you might like it to because you don't have to go that far from the shopping stores. I love the music they play because it's calm and fun music that a lot of people know.  The set up is so good. There are two floors. On the first floor there's a bar for adults. On the second floor there's all the food. If you want to go to a buffet you can go to Fire+Ice because you get the food exactly like you are in a buffet. The food is all set up. You get the food you want. The only difference about is that the food is frozen. There is a table in the middle where you can watch them cook it. It only takes a few minutes or seconds for them to cook it for you. If you want you can bring 15 people with you because there are big tables. There are a lot of tables on the second floor. The chefs don't have any kitchens they have a cooking table in the middle of the second floor. You can even watch your food be cooked and other people's food be cooked as well. On the second floor there are decorations on the ceiling made out of wood. They look like anything you would put in a burger, like cheese, buns, ketchup, salad, tomatoes, and anything you could expect to put in a burger. My favorite is the cheese because they made it like the cheese with the holes in it. They are perfectly cut out. The view is pretty cool that you can see the park across the street. You can see the entrance to the park and the playground. The view at night is really cool because the lights are really bright and you can see the park much better.  The food is so good. Like I said the Alfredo spaghetti with shrimp in it is my favorite. The reason why I like the Alfredo spaghetti is because the sweetness of the Alfredo is so good. With normal sauce it makes the spaghetti taste dry which is my opinion. To me sometimes, with tomato sauce, it tastes kind of dry. But, with alfredo sauce, since it tastes so sweet, it's like it is blowing my mouth up. They also have an ice cream bar, chinese food, veggies, salsa bar, rice, seafood and fruit. The ice cream bar has so many kinds of toppings. The toppings are oreos, m and ms, chocolate chips, hot fuge, and resies pesies. When I walk in the restaurant I smell all the food that is being cooked at once. When you eat the food it's not to cold, hot, or burnt. It is perfectly made. The Chinese food they have is the rice, chicken and veggie rice. A way to know you like the food is if you get very messy. Usually when people like the food, the get more and more plates. When I got more plates, I get very full and my face is covered with Alfredo sauce and spaghetti.  If you live in Boston then you will be able to go to Fire+and Ice very easily. It's very close to the train station. It's in Back Bay near the orange line. It's also very close to Chinatown since Back Bay is the stop almost in the middle between Oak Grove and Forest Hills. It is about two stops away from the middle. When you exit Fire and Ice, around the corner there is Marshall's. There is also a little walk-in area next to Marshall's where there are shopping stores. There is also the Prudential Mall that is very close to Fire and Ice and there are lots of shopping stores there and there are lots of other restaurants and places there too.  Those are all three reasons why I think Fire+Ice is my favorite restaurant ever. Whenever you go to Fire+Ice I hope you like it so much. I still have a feeling that you will like the food no matter what.  - Written by Laila, a third grader in Ms. Taryn's clas\\n\\nName: Pronti Sandwich Co.; Review: My family found new favorite eats last night!

My name is Audrey and I'm going to tell you about Wonder Spice Cafe!  Wonder Spice Cafe is the best restaurant ever! I love Wonder spice because the food is delicious, the service is great, and the location is perfect!! When you walk into Wonder Spice, you will think that you have walked into a dream. You will smell the good food cooking on the stove, and you see customers sitting at the tables, waiting patiently for their food. Everything you get is always delicious.  Wonder Spice Cafe's food is one of the best things you will ever try!! The spring rolls are really good, nice and crispy. The shumais are warm and soft. They're like swallowing a big warm hug. The golden triangles are crispy and crunchy, full of flavor. Their pad thai is the dream. It's mixed up with the most delicious shrimp and chicken I have ever tasted. Wonder Spice also has the best drinks. It has water, milk, juice, and more!  You have got to try out Wonder Spice's food!!!!!  Wonder Spice Cafe's location is just as good as their food. They have a parking lot near the restaurant, and sometimes you can get a really good parking spot in front of the restaurant. Wonder Spice Cafe is located in JP (Jamaica Plain), near JP Licks. If you do not have a car, you can take a taxi, uber, or lyft. Wonder Spice Cafe is also near Dunkin Donuts, Fresh Hair, Curtis Hall, Boing, and a playground, baseball field, CVS Pharmacy, and Noodle Barn.  Wonder Spice Cafe's service is really good, too. The waiters and waitresses are really nice. They always greet you kindly as you come in, and the chefs make your food quickly (25 - 30 min) and entertain you with drinks and appetizers.  Wonder Spice has the best food, service, and location!! You have to try out Wonder Spice Cafe!</td>\n",

       "      <td>Name: BBQ Chicken; Review: We stumbled across bb.q a few days after it opened when its menu was still half unavailable. It didn't matter. The chicken was phenomenal. GO HERE! Easily the best Korean fried chicken we've had in Boston. Incredibly cheap for the price, with generous portions at 10 pieces for ~$11. We tried their Secret Spicy and the Gang-Jeong, and both were wonderful in their own right (and perfectly cooked). But the real star came on a repeat visit when we got the Hot and Spicy (which was not on the menu the first time we went). We were hoping for spicy chicken and GOOD GOD we were rewarded. This was incredibly spicy and it didn't matter one bit. The chicken was moist and incredibly flavorful, and the sauce hit that perfect note of sweet, savory, and searingly spicy. This is really not chicken for the faint of heart, but for those feeling brave, give it a shot. It's wonderful.  Can't wait to get more from them\\nName: Chicked's Chicken &amp; Grill; Review: Very bad tasting food.

I ordered a seafood mala bang that was moderately spicy. It was just right. I can eat pretty spicy and I think their spicy scale is appropriate (unlike some Thai restaurants...You order a mild spicy dish and next thing you know you turn into a dragon blowing up flames.) The dumplings appetizer was also good.   I gave this place a four stars because I had a sense that the food is not entirely authentic. I came all the way from San Diego and this place was advertised as Szechuan authentic restaurant. I would appreciate if the menu would indicate which dishes are particularly *authentic*. :\\nName: Sichuan Gourmet Billerica; Review: Best Restaurant in Billerica. You might at first be thrown off by this tiny restaurant's appearance, crammed in a tiny strip mall with a liquor store and a laundromat, but don't let that fool you. Sichuan Gourmet has, hands down, the best food in Billerica, and for Chinese food beats any of the Chinatown places I've been to. The trick is to not order typical \"American\" Chinese dishes like Beef and Broccoli or Sweet and Sour Chicken, which are not very good here, -- the dishes you've never heard of are going to be the best.  I should at this point mention that because the cuisine is from the Sichuan region, much of their food is spicy. Unlike many places, when they put those pepper symbols on the menu, they mean it. However, the spiciness is never a raw overpowering burning -- they dishes carefully balance \"Ma\" (a tingly, electric sensation), \"La\" (spicy), and \"Tang\" (a hot burning sensation) with sweet and savory flavors that can convert many people who think they hate spicy food. They aren't just adding cayenne to their dishes like so many other places do. They also have plenty of non-spicy dishes, and are happy to make any of their menu items less spicy.  For spicy dishes, my favorites are the \"Pork and Eggplant with Yu Xiang Sauce\" which appears on their separate specials menu (it has perfect balance of spicy sauce, sweet eggplant, and savory pork), the Dan Dan Noodles (which the waiter should warn you need to be mixed before eating), any of the \"with Spicy Chili Sauce\" dishes (which are meat or fish served in a red spicy sauce with Napa Cabbage), the \"Old Sichuan Chicken\" (a dried fried chicken with an interesting crust -- the house specialty), the \"Gangou Dry Fish Filet\" (similar to the Old Sichuan Chicken but with fish), the \"Sliced Roast Beef &amp; Tendon w. Chili Sauce\" (if you like tendon), and the \"Hot &amp; Sour Wonton Soup\" (listed under \"Sichuan Delicacies\" not \"Soup\", and very different from a typical Americanized Hot &amp; Sour).  For non-spicy dishes, I would recommend the Scallion Pancake (the only Americanized appetizer I would recommend here),\"Sichuan Cold Noodles - none spicy\" (cold noodles in a vinegary peanut sauce), \"Sichuan Style String Beans\" (a Sichuan classic, and done very well here), \"Meat Ball Sichuan Style\" (A soup-like hot pot with huge meatballs and lots of vegetables), and the Sesame Sweet Potato Cakes (A hot soft sweet-potato pancake that is stuffed with a sweet bean paste, coated in sesame seeds, and drizzled with a sweet sauce).  This restaurant also has fancier locations in Framingham and Brookline, but the food is much better in Billerica.

Amateras ramen seems to be a popular spot for a quick bowl of ramen on those plentiful chilly Boston days. We went there around 5:45pm on a Thursday night and were seated immediately. The boiled gyoza appetizer was great - the wrappers were some of the softest ones I'd ever tasted. My 5X spicy miso ramen was flavorful. I didn't know how Amateras' spice scale compared relative to other places so I started there, but next time I will definitely be going 10x. My husband's level 2 spicy green monster was definitely the spicier of the two. The thai chiles in the clear broth definitely packed a punch.  The staff is polite, friendly, and attentive.

They now have a no spice option if you want to taste their delicious chicken without the spicy jam.  The service was great and our food was ready for pickup the exact time we got to the restaurant. Our server was kind and we didn't wait at all.  I got two box meals with two Thai teas. The box meals come with two pieces of fried chicken, sticky rice, shrimp chips, green papaya salad. Both of the boxes were exactly the same so don't worry about consistency!  Fried Chicken: The chicken had such crazy crispy skin! After driving home for 30 minutes it was still crispy and the meat inside was juicy. The sauce on top is REALLY flavorful and I thought it went well with the other items in the box. I thought it had a nice spice which wasn't too much but left a nice heat on your tongue. If you don't like spice thought it will be wAYYYY too spicy for you so stick to the no spice option.  Sticky Rice: This tasted like normal sticky rice and was great with the chicken or the salad!  Papaya Salad: This salad had so many flavors, it was really refreshing to eat along with the chicken! Though it was waaaay too spicy for me it was perfect for my boyfriend. I thought the papaya salad was spicier than the chicken lol.  Shrimp chips: These are the normal shrimp chips you eat. I think they were really nice to eat between the salad and the chicken and I even used it like a chip to hold the salad and chicken!

I ordered Lamb Biriyani with baby corn Manchurian and I should say my taste buds had an amazing treat!  About the biriyani:  1. The spice mix was perfect. It wasn't bland, it wasn't too spicy. It was just perfect. Some places add too much spice randomly (when you ask them to make it spicy), which ruins the flavor and your stomach. Mumbai spice had the right amount of spice. 2. The lamb was cooked perfectly. A lot of places tend to over cook lamb, but Mumbai spice got it right. 3. The portion was generous 4. The price was reasonable.  The baby corn Manchurian was awesome too. It had a nice crispness to it. Its refreshing to see different items instead of the regular paneer/ chicken Manchurians.

For non-spicy dishes, I would recommend the Scallion Pancake (the only Americanized appetizer I would recommend here),\"Sichuan Cold Noodles - none spicy\" (cold noodles in a vinegary peanut sauce), \"Sichuan Style String Beans\" (a Sichuan classic, and done very well here), \"Meat Ball Sichuan Style\" (A soup-like hot pot with huge meatballs and lots of vegetables), and the Sesame Sweet Potato Cakes (A hot soft sweet-potato pancake that is stuffed with a sweet bean paste, coated in sesame seeds, and drizzled with a sweet sauce).  This restaurant also has fancier locations in Framingham and Brookline, but the food is much better in Billerica. If you're looking for authentic or spicy food, it's worth the drive\\nName: The Halal Guys; Review: I used to live across the street from a Halal Guys in Chicago so I was happy they have one here in Boston. When you compare it to other fast-casual chains like Cava, Sweet Green, or Chipotle, it's definitely more \"bare bones\" and less fancy. They definitely don't have a \"health\" equity and they don't have many options. But dang this place is delicious. I always get the regular combo platter which comes with beef and chicken, yellow rice, lettuce, and tomatoes. It's also a significant portion for the price which I appreciate.  Servers are friendly but there's not much seating so better to-go than eat-in.  Come in for a quick bite and get the white sauce and a little spicy (it's VERY spicy and I tend to like spicy)  Share review Write an update Edit revie</td>\n",

I had to ask for two things again because they overlooked what I wrote on the menu that you're supposed to fill out. Also, the container on tables where skewers are thrown out need to be cleaned! The servers just remove the empty skewers and leave the dirty containers for next customers. I was appalled, looked so disgusting.

Like the main waitress was kind of rude may be she had a long day. Food I would say was ok. I would suggest never try lamb or goat because the meat is never tender this is my second experience. I ordered a goat biryani. There were tiny tiny bones so it was really uncomfortable to eat, I ate just two spoons and gave up, well goat and lamb is with bones but tiny bones are really risky if you swallow you might get choked. Biryani was I would say atleast a week old ( easily figures out with the taste and size of the rice grain) was very spicy, the masala was not in proportion. Goan curry was amazing loved the taste. Nan was ok no complains. Kachori chat was also ok.  One more thing I was not sure of they already add tips which I guess was 15% and do they expect us to write more tips because below of the invoice there was suggestion for tips. Not sure. Overall I would give one more try and see if they can make some changes\\nName: China Gourmet Restaurant; Review: Totally not spicy. The taste is ok, but the Hunan cuisine has been improved. Jintang fat beef pickled pepper taste is too light, sour and spicy appetizers can not be done. The chopped peppers in the chopped pepper fish head looked much, but in fact there was nothing spicy. Look at Fuzhou cuisine like this.\\nName: Chilli Thai Bistro; Review: REALLY good Thai food!! Love it. Wish i lived around here so i could frequent this place.

       "      <td>Name: Amateras Ramen; Review: TL;DR - flavorful ramen at reasonable prices served by friendly and attentive staff. Heed the spice warnings on the menu.  Amateras ramen seems to be a popular spot for a quick bowl of ramen on those plentiful chilly Boston days. We went there around 5:45pm on a Thursday night and were seated immediately. The boiled gyoza appetizer was great - the wrappers were some of the softest ones I'd ever tasted. My 5X spicy miso ramen was flavorful. I didn't know how Amateras' spice scale compared relative to other places so I started there, but next time I will definitely be going 10x. My husband's level 2 spicy green monster was definitely the spicier of the two. The thai chiles in the clear broth definitely packed a punch.  The staff is polite, friendly, and attentive. Our waters were kept filled, table was set and cleared promptly, and our server processed our payment quickly\\n\\nName: Avana Sushi; Review: The sushi is high quality and fairly priced. I recommend takeout as the restaurant is not ideal for eating inside. We enjoyed the rainbow roll, spicy tuna, spicy crab, calamari and eel-avocado roll. 5 stars\\n\\nName: India Quality Restaurant; Review: If this is the quality of food in India, then I do not want to go. It blows my mind that it has such great reviews.  For starters, the place looks dirty and isn't welcoming. The waiters were many but none of them took care of us.  Now on to the disappointing food. We ordered many things because we were excited the place had such praising reviews. I even asked how long they have been in business, 31 years and counting.  We got samosas as starters, they were nothing but a frozen flash fried catastrophe. The garlic naan bread was drenched in oil, had too much garlic and wasn't cooked throughout. This was also for the second naan, pashwari which had too much honey in it.  The diet cokes we ordered came in a dirty glass, as a matter of fact all the glasses we got were dirty.  I had lamb madras, it was a watery flavorless substance that I did not recognize as being that dish. The taste was only of spiciness and the lamb felt more like a rubbery beef. We also got chicken korma and it was distasteful as well. The rice we got was too flavorful with spices they used and it took away from other flavors.  The bill wasn't cheap and definitely not worth the money. I do not recommend this place to anyone. Please don't waste your time and money\\n\\nName: Suishaya; Review: Friends of mine took me once to this place, with Korean and Japanese styles dishes, inside Chinatown hood.  If you look for a fork, knife or spoon, don't look for them, it's supposed to use your provided chopsticks and in case you order something that it's mandary in order to help eating it, they will be provided.  This was my first Korean restaurant in the US, so I declined their Sushi section in the menu and I headed to the Korean dishes.  First of all, you'll get some apetizers as red beans, bean spouts, carrot with chilli.  First time I tried Okdol Bibimbap, it came in a really hot pan, with all the ingredients ready to be cooked in it and a small recipient with spicy sauce. You have to be fast and start mixing it to don't get your food burnt. I ordered it with spicy pork, so it was spicy and very hot, it took me more than half hour to finish it, the amount of food also was big tho. My experience was food, the food, service and the local were good.  The second time I had Jam Bang with Korean noodle, also a big bowl came to the table, with the usual thick Korean noddles, mussels, shrimps and a selection of vegetables. As it was raining it was the perfect choice, it was both hot and spicy. The noodles and the soup were tasty and flavourful, I usually don't eat soup but this one it was really worth it.  As I came with some friends both times I tried Bulgogi Beef, that was pretty good.  The only bad things is they don't have beer nor home made tea, so don't expect anything good for drink.  The second time the fire alarm was triggered as some dishes are really hot and smoke comes out of them, but it's a mere anecdote\\n\\nName: China Gourmet Restaurant; Review: Totally not spicy.

We waited nearly an hour for four appetizers. After I asked the “server” (I use the word loosely) to cancel the appetizers (because I assumed the entrees would be arriving in any minute), three of the appetizers finally appeared.  The fourth appetizer—a spinach salad—never did show up. Somehow, the kitchen was able to prepare one spinach salad for our table, but the second was evidently too high a bar to clear.  When the appetizers arrived, the manager assured me that the entrees were right behind them. He also looked me in the eye and (as it turned out) lied to me, saying that one entree (a grilled chicken sandwich) in particular was holding things up, but those entrees would be out shortly.  Three of the four entrees arrived after another wait, but that grilled chicken sandwich also turned out to be too much of a challenge for this establishment and it simply never arrived.  The kicker was this policy statement from their website: “To ensure that we can honor your reservations in a timely manner, we have a 2 hour maximum seating time during the prime times.” Deeply ironic, when, in the two hours we wasted at this establishment, this is a restaurant that couldn’t actually serve four appetizers and four entrees to four patrons.  At Darryl’s, to paraphrase P.T. Barnum, you can feed some of the people some of the time.  I have never written a review like this before, but, in two decades of restaurant-going as an adult, I’ve never seen “service” like this.  Two words—offered by either the “server” or the manager at any point—would have kept me from writing this review.  Darryl’s, say it with me, for future reference: “I’m sorry.”  Goodness knows you should be\\nName: Sorellina; Review: Sorellina is good, but not worth a 5 star rating.  We dined with them this past Saturday.  The atmosphere is sophisticated and classy.  While we saw a few t-shirts and a ball cap at one table, the dress is upscale casual.  A sport coat for guys and a dress for the ladies is spot on.  Their service was very good and our location by a window added to the evening.  We started off with several appetizers including the Polpo (octopus), Cavatelli (rabbit and pasta), and Maccheroncelli (meatball, sauce and parmigiana).  All were prepared excellent and challenged the palate with sophisticated tastes.  But that's where the good food ended and the main courses were average.  Two of us got the  Milanese which was presented well, but dry and with little flavor.  The other dishes, Veal saltimbocca, and the Filet Mignon were again bland.  I don't know why the appetizers could be so good and the mains fair at best.   For the prices paid one would expect much better than average.  The 4 stars is a reprieve do to the excellent appetizers, but if it wasn't for those it would have been a 3\\nName: Sky Restaurant; Review: We went to Sky this past weekend, and the experience was mixed.  I'll start with the bad.  The host at the front of the restaurant doesn't seem very friendly - no smiling at all and seemed a bit underdressed.  After sitting down and ordering a bottle of wine, the waitress poured us tastes of the wine and then left.  This seemed a bit odd, since every other restaurant usually pours the first glass. We sat for about 20 min before receiving bread and had to request it from one of the bussers.  We ordered two appetizers the chef board and the fried calamari.  Both of these appetizers were lackluster.  The fried calamari wasn't light and easy to eat, instead it was chewy and overly breaded.  Our entrees took over an hour to arrive at the table, but when they did the quality was excellent.  That brings me to the good, the swordfish I ordered was clearly fresh, and the filet my wife ordered was cooked perfectly.   With a bit of fine tuning on the service, better appetizers that match freshness of entress this place would be 4 stars in my book, but without those elements it falls a bit short\\nName: Chicken and Rice Guys; Review: Good food. Good quantity. Price is good for the amount of food available. Halal chicken is served with rice. It would be better if customers were able to choose between the type of salad they want with their order but overall a good experience\\nName: Turner Fisheries Restaurant & Bar; Review: Our party of 6 went for drinks and appetizers in the bar early last Saturday evening.  Oysters and littleneck were fantastic, the drinks very good, and the service excellent.  One of the better fried calamari’s we’ve tasted and the chowder is wonderful   \n",

Owned by the same chef of Tiger Mama and Sweet Cheeks; the same attention to food and cocktails is highlighted by their giant chalkboard sign menu.  The fortified wine cocktails are fun and interesting. No table service as this is just a small bar. This place typically draws a crowd every Friday and Saturday night. Food menu is all snacks, do not expect a full menu (adult snack bar is in the name.. duh). Service is top notch, even when crowded. Definitely a must for a quick drink in the Fenway neighborhood\\nName: Forum; Review: I stopped in here for a pre-duck tour snack with a friend and we loved the cocktails: Tom Collins and Moscow Mule. We also had appetizers, mine being a short rib egg roll and while it was delicious, it was so heavy. Too heavy before sitting down for ages. Otherwise, this is a pretty nice place to go to for after-work cocktails or even to host a small birthday celebration\\nName: Better Sorts Social Club; Review: A little bit noisier than my eyes told me from pictures (I realize that's on me and ridiculous). But holy cow, cocktails. Our bar tenders were amazing and made some high quality cocktails that kept my group very happy for several hours. Classy joint, dark bathrooms, out of this world bar tenders, louder than ideal music, comfy bar chairs\\nName: Blue Inc.; Review: Great spot for funky cocktails and delicious eats. Have boozy adult milkshakes which are a must\\nName: Avila; Review: We stumble in here every once in a while for cocktails or apps. Try the Fried Goat Cheese Balls - AMAZING! Any of their cocktails are great, and some are pretty unique in terms of flavor. Skip the \"New Fashioned\" and stick with the old one, though... Service in here is great, and though the place as a whole looks upscale, you're fine in nice jeans at the bar. Don't expect to watch the game on any huge TVs, but do expect great conversation with the staff as well as the many regulars that frequent the bar for dinner (Park Plaza is right there...and the folks that live there seem to be unable to cook their own meals ;-)   \n",

When entering the host was wearing a hoodie.  As we walked through the North End we had a concern because all of the restaurants were full and seemed very busy.  Not the case upon our arrival at La Galleria.  There was only 3 or 4 other tables with guests.  The overwhelming smell of this Italian restaurant is not garlic, fresh tomatoes or the essence of fine Italian food being cooked, for example the smells one enjoys while walking by the nearby restaurants.  What do you smell from the open kitchen?  The fryer that smells like old oil, Ugh.  The quality and freshness of the food (muscles, tomatoes on Brushetta, Halibut) was excellent.  However, the preparation was nothing you would go out of your way for.  The burning question would I go back, probably not.  If you are in Boston for only a few days  this is not as expensive as other nearby places the food is OK and you should be able to get a reservation.  If your looking for authentic Italian food, this is not the place.  It is neither romantic or funky.  They had a TV on the wall with a basket ball game and kind of indy rock on the stereo.  It was just really odd and wouldn't want to dine here with friends as it isn't a warm comfortable place even though the exposed brick was warm and welcomin\\nName: Coolidge Market; Review: Was skeptical about the outside of the place but a friend told me that the Italian sub is the best. For $4.50 you can get the best Italian sub in the city. It was absolutely delicious, and made with love by a little old woman. 100000% recommend. Although I am sad that no other Italian sandwich will compare\\nName: Punto Rojo; Review: The best Colombian restaurant I have been in this country !! I live in NY and I came to visit Boston and this place really made me happy with its food and good service, the price for the quality and quantity of food is more than perfect !! I looked at many Reviews of restaurants nearby and this was the best and the best choice! All very tasty!\\nName: Casalinga; Review: Being an Italian raised in East Boston I rarely find authentic Italian cuisine when I dine out. This is not the case at Casalinga. The arincinis ( rice balls ) are delicious, the lobster ravioli tender and flavorful, and the eggplant parmesan wonderful. Superb quality Italian cooking at a very reasonable price. A hidden gem\\nName: Oliver Street Cafe; Review: I've honestly never had an Italian sub like this one. It will change your life   \n",

negative start, I would. Your overpriced sushi taste similar or worst than a cheap supermarket sushi. You should change your chef, because he/she obviously doesn't know what the real sushi taste like. I would never mind paying the  fancy price for a good food, but let's face the fact that your food doesn't deserve the price. I've been to many upscale sushi restaurants around the world, noting taste as awful as your sushi, especially for the price, 3 rolls + miso soup for $120.. Ridiculous for the quality. I would not pay $5 for your sushi, if I only knew it would be this awful\\nName: Gogo Ya; Review: For Boston, this is top rate Sushi\\nName: Symphony Sushi; Review: Every time I go to a new restaurant, I try to find the menu item that'll be my go-to in the future. Symphony Sushi is very close to where I live, and it has been for years now, so of course it has preference over other sushi places for that reason. Time and time again I've tried to find something, anything on the menu that I think is actually worth ordering again. I haven't found a single thing. I've ordered something different almost every time I've gone, and nothing has taken my heart. Everything has been perfectly mediocre. I hate to talk about my exes, but back in Albany I had a sushi place called Sushi Tei that I was absolutely smitten with. The prices were good, and the sushi was so tasty it was unreal. But Albany isn't known for its sushi, so I figured a city like Boston would have its standards a lot higher, right? Symphony Sushi hasn't given me anything that's measured up, despite my many attempts to give it another chance. If you're just craving sushi in general and you're local like I am, this is your place. But if you want something with more substance, something that'll actually wow you, you'll have to look elsewhere. I'm sorry. :   \n",

This is my family’s first option for pupusas. But I’ve also tried some of their Mexican dishes, I’d say their Mexican dishes are not typical Mexican food it’s more like Taco Bell. However, this is a great restaurant to take your family. Great service, the ladies are always polite and attentive. I wish I could give 5 stars but you guys need to improve on your Mexican dishes. I do recommend this restaurant\\nName: Casa Romero; Review: Came here for a very early dinner around 5 PM on a Sunday. This place is accessible via an alley and the first thing you noticed the beautiful door. You walk downstairs to a heavily-decorated Mexican restaurant with all the decor from Mexico. It has a very traditional Mexican restaurant feel.  FOOD: Seemed to be a little bit more authentic than your average Mexican food restaurant. We realized that since we arrived before 6 and would leave by 7 that we could order the early bird special which has 3 courses for $24. I was hungry so I went for it.  Marinated Chicken Wings with Mole Sauce - These chicken wings were on the fattier side but the sauce was rich and delicious. This also came with fried plantains on top which was a nice sweet element. I LOVE fried plantains.  Pulled Roasted Pork (aka Cochinita Pibil) - SO delicious. Perfect balance of a little spicy with very savory. The meat was so tender. I wish I could have eaten this all night.  Mexican-Style Crepes - not sure what makes this Mexican besides the caramel on top but this is also filled with sliced bananas. Came with a side of vanilla ice cream. Delicious and wish I had more.  Portions were on the smaller side compared to other Mexican restaurants, though that may have been because it was part of the early bird special. I would definitely come back for the early bird special.  Tip: If you order before 6 and leave before 7, get the early bird special. $24 for 3 courses. What a deal! Keep that in mind if you are hungry one afternoon in Back Bay\\nName: Burro Bar South End; Review: Came here with a group of 7 friends on a Friday night without reservations. They have a big bar as well as a lounge area that is first come first served so if you don't have a reservation, you can still get a seat relatively quickly if are lucky.  AMBIANCE: very lively, one of the most fun nights I've had in Boston.  SERVICE: pretty good, they accidentally brought us 2 Mexican Ice Cream Sundaes and gave us the second one for free so that was a nice plus.  FOOD: not too big of a menu for a Mexican restaurant but it has something for everyone. My friends seemed to like their kale salad and short rib tacos (the latter of which did seem small for $7) but I had the street cart chicken, one of my favorite things to get at Mexican restaurants. It's a well-cooked, well-spiced half chicken with Mexican rice and fried plantains. Hearty and filling, a nice balance of sweet and spicy.  For dessert, we had the Mexican Ice Cream Sundae which was my favorite thing we got. Three different ice creams: chipotle chocolate, coconut avocado, and dulce de leche. Then it's topped with horchata whipped cream, Marcona almonds, caramelized plantains, and tequila soaked cherries. I could have eaten this whole thing by myself but unfortunately I had to share.  Overall, burro bar was great for a casual night out with friends but I definitely want to try and check out some other South End restaurants before coming bac\\nName: Tenoch Mexican; Review: I want places that attempt to be real Mexican food to survive in Boston, so I'm rating Tenoch a little higher than it deserves. This is about as close to authentic as I've seen in Boston, but it still leaves something to be desired. I'm a greasy sandwich junkie, so tortas are one of my favorite Mexican foods. This torta was OK. All the toppings were there, but the meat wasn't well seasoned and the telera bread was limp without the crunch it should have on the outside. I'll go again because there's nowhere for a torta fix—until I leave the Mexican food desert that is the Northeast\\nName: El Pelón Taqueria; Review: This place was a HAVEN in a Mexican-food desert in Boston. I tried so hard to find Mexican food comparable to what I'm used to as a native Texan, and trust me - there were a lot of failures. I brought my brother to this place as a break from his first year of college, and was pleasantly surprised that it was tiny, but packed!! The smell was INTOXICATING, and I could barely wait to order!! The choice was easy to make - El Guapo all the way. Plantains inside of a burrito? GENIUS. The best part was that the fried plantains just elevated the flavor of an already amazing burrito - the grilled steak, mexican rice, black beans, salsa, lettuce, and crema were perfectly en pointe. And the wait was short, even with a long line!  I've trekked out here in rain, snow, busy days after work - it's worth it! While the food is super authentic, the decor is really eclectic and cozy - there's so much to look at! The whole history of the place is written on the walls and is a great conversation starter.  I dream of coming back, and I highly recommend! Super affordable, excellent Mexican food   \n",

The service was fantastic, the food was amazing, and the atmosphere was authentic.  The chef here really knows what she wants the guest to experience and she makes it happen\\nName: House of Siam; Review: I've been here a number of times, one of them being for an anniversary dinner, and it seriously fits all of my needs. It's classy enough that you can bring someone on a date, yet casual enough that you can head there after work when you're just hankering for some thai food. The really attentive staff and super good food will keep me coming here for a long, long time\\nName: Mastro's Ocean Club; Review: We were six people celebrating an anniversary. There were no champagne flutes available. They brought over a bread basket with two rolls for six people. It was so noisy you could not speak to the person directly next to you.  The Halibut came out overcooked and when  told about it it was sent back and I was told to eat  the sides while waiting. I told the others to eat while their meals were still hot and by the time the second piece of fish arrived (not properly cooked either),everyone had finished their meals and the sides wire cold. We had to remove plates and glasses so that we had room on the table and we put them on the floor.  When the manager (Peter) was told about it he brought over a horrible bottle of dessert wine and a tray of desserts on the house. Once that was done they forgot that we were celebrating an anniversary. Peter, the manager who was on that evening was not responsive when I called and left a message several times after we left the restaurant. Boston has many fine restaurants - I would never go back and spend money at this one. They lost six good customers\\nName: Lolita Back Bay; Review: My girlfriend and I came here for our 5th anniversary, an we were not disappointed in the slightest. Lengthy review ahead, because I truly enjoyed my experience here.  When I made the reservation, I noted that it was our anniversary and that, if possible, I'd like to have flowers waiting at the table ahead of time. As it turns out, the tables have flowers (real roses, too) by default. Along with beautiful silverware and plates. We were sat and our server wished us a happy anniversary, which I did not expect; so that was quite a nice little touch.  The meal began with a complementary grapefruit-tequila palette cleanser, which was very nice and unexpected. The shot of tequila that went in it was free as well! I thought this may have been a perk of it being our anniversary, but it turns out that every table gets this as well!  We split a pitcher of the Diablo margarita, which was the perfect blend of spicy, sweet, and tequila-y; I definitely recommend. We were each able to have several glasses of it, making it quite a fair price. The glasses were rimmed a lightly spiced sugar, along with lime and pepper slices.  Chips and salsa/dip are also complimentary here. The chips, seemingly homemade, were great; not too salty, not oily at all. The salsas/dip were a delicious spicy verde salsa, a nice, mild, tomato-y dip and some kind of chipotle aioli thing (I'm not a fan of sour cream/mayo based dips, so I didn't try it so I don't know actually know what it was). The verde was to die for, though!  We each got an app. She ordered the Guac Fresca, which she said was the creamiest, most amazing guac she's ever had. I ordered the empanadas, which were great. They were certainly nothing too unique, but were very well done and I enjoyed them for sure.  As for mains, I ordered the Carne Asada and she the Cauliflower Tacos. My steak, while rather small, was impeccable. Perfectly tendered, subtly charred, and oh so flavorful. I was initially disappointed by the size, but it more than made up for it in flavor and texture. The cauliflower tacos were amazing, as well. They managed to pack lots of different flavors and textures into these tacos, but nothing overpowered the other. Also, the cauliflower was fried to perfection with a nice thing, crunchy coating. The cauliflower in those tacos could be made into an app by itself.  We decided not to order dessert, as we had things waiting for us at home (and we were pretty stuffed), but we received yet ANOTHER complementary item, sour-apple cotton candy. Every table received this after their meal, but in ours, they stuck three beautiful roses into it, yet another unexpected, lovely detail. I didn't specifically ask for this, so they took it upon themselves to do this for us.  As for the restaurant itself, it's really something unique. The setting is ultra-gothic, quite dark, and definitely not something you see in a restaurant. The gothic theme did give it a certain romance, but that was diluted somewhat by the volume of the crowd and the London-bar-esque music. Ultimately we could have chosen a more romantic setting for our anniversary, but this was certainly an amazing experience and I regret nothing.  Oh and our server was very courteous and very prompt, but never pushy. A+ to her.  Come here with friends, family, a loved one, or by yourself and grab a drink at the bar. It's a very interesting, unique location perfect for a night out. It's not exactly kid or elderly friendly, so keep that in mind\\nName: Gaslight; Review: We come here for our anniversary, and the service we receive is enough to keep us coming back every year.  I just add a little note notifying them of the occasion, and the entire staff seemed to know (in a positive way).  What blew my mind was when we arrived, without a word to the bartender, they directed us to the bar to wait for our table.  The bartender already knew who we were and handed us two glasses of champagne and wished us a happy anniversary with a smile.  This really impressed me, it was so seamless.  After a short while they brought us to the table.  The waiters we have had are always some of the best I have had in Boston, although we admittedly do not dine out like this very often.  The food is always amazing.  French onion soup split for 2 is the way to go every time.  In recent times we have had the steak, the duck, and the mussles.  All were fantastic.  Sitting outside on a nice evening is wonderful as well, as long as it is decently warm.  (they do have heaters!)  This is a great spot for a special occasion!!   \n",

The big bartender was an jerk right away. As we sat he proceeded give our group a hard time and call us names in Italian, including racial insults. Little did he know that one of our group spoke Italian and called him out on it. We decided to leave and asked for the check, he placed the check far from my reach so when I went to grab it I accidentally tipped my glass. I was able to catch my glass there was a small spill. As I tried to clean it up with my napkin he swatted my hand away and took my unfinished glass of wine. I apologized for the accident with, I am sorry to only be told in return not as sorry as he was. No pizza or wine is worth this rude behavior. especially with other pizza shops down the road\\nName: Kung Fu Tea; Review: UPDATE : my friends drinks were all made incorrectly and they had ordered some to go and still messed it up. Worst experience we travel an hour away to this place. Never going back.  Me and my small group of friends visited this place, and we asked if they were closed and the employee said no. (We asked because they were closing in a few minutes) so I’m the last person in line to put in my order and he says he can’t take my order because it was already 11 so they’re technically “closed”. My friends ordered their drinks and I was left with nothing. We should’ve asked for a refund and left, but I was so annoyed I couldn’t think. If I could give no stars as a review I would. First time there and never going back.  I’m seriously frustrated and I want to contact cooperate\\nName: Audubon; Review: This is a shout out mostly to Jay, the host, and the fantastic waitstaff we had a few nights ago. The food's also great, of course, but we had nine people on a group outing during a freezing night, which is asking a bit much of such a cozy (small) place.  No reservations allowed, but we were on the wait list. Unfortunately, horrible traffic for a local event (ski jumping inside Fenway Park of all things) delayed most of the group well beyond the time Jay could reasonably hold our tables. He would have been completely right to send us on our way, but instead, when a sizable group deserted the long, thin high top table separating the entry from the bar, he sat those of us who had arrived and reserved the rest of the space for our group.  Thanks again for helping salvage our evening\\nName: Dillon's; Review: TL;DR Awful, disrespectful service. Called ahead to secure a space for a large group and we were ignored, treated like a nuisance, and basically made clear we were not wanted. None of us are going back.  Full (Long) Story I work at a store nearby of about 250 employees. We will occasionally have gatherings at local spots to celebrate birthdays, promotions, just general fun.  A friend was having a birthday and called about a week ahead to see if DIllons could accommodate a large-ish group of about 30, with folks coming and going throughout the night. She tried to book the place for a Friday night, so she knew it may be busy and wanted to make sure this could work. They said this was fine.  When my group arrived after our shift, a few folks had already shown up early. They got a table on the patio but when we tried to join them, they warned us that they had been told we’d all get thrown out of too many of us tried to sit on the patio.  So the rest of us decide to go to the bar. Their front bar is not super large, so this ended up being a disaster and it took close to 20 minutes for the first of us to get a drink. By this point the birthday girl showed up and was trying to secure us a space.  They decided to stick us on these tables towards the back; not the back room but rather ones that line the hall to get to the back. The tables could fit maybe 8 people comfortably and anybody standing was blocking the hall to get to the back.  Another group had been giving that room. We were told if we wanted table service one person would have to put down a credit card to assure payment. With us expecting upwards of 50 people coming and going through the night, we obviously weren’t going to do that, but we were not getting service at the bar.  Once the group who had the back space showed up, it was a miserable, cramped mess. It was obvious the staff didn’t want us there. I ended up leaving, having never gotten a drink.  After the fact the rest of our group left and went to another spot nearby who’s always accommodated us happily, knew us well and had no issue with the large, transient group.  Needless to say, never going back, and our staff of 250+ people all heard about how we were treated and take their business elsewhere as well\\nName: Mariel; Review: If able, I wouldn't even give them that 1 star, they deserve 0. Yes, I do not write many reviews, thats because most restaurants I eat at are consistently good, so I never felt the need to review. But this place I couldn't not share this experience. This place just opened, they should've saved the money spent on cheesy chandeliers and decor and bought some decent food to serve(since at the end of the day people come to EAT) and a better, much more professional staff, from the manager down. Or just made it a Taco Bell, which serves better food and even provides better service. We were celebrating my wife's 40th birthday with 3 couples, SIX PEOPLE,  three course meal, so we obviously ordered SEVERAL appetizers, 6 entrees and 6 deserts, making this an accurate variety of menu review. One word: HORRIBLE!! I actually felt so bad that this was my suggestion since it was new, obviously none of our group had ever been and my wife loves trying new restaurants throughout Boston. I saw it just opened and all their advertising, so I thought it would be a nice surprise just like by inviting her 2 best friends and their husbands to join us. How bad did I feel?? Bad enough that the following Sat night I took the same group (all SIX OF US) out to a good restaurant for the experience my wife deserved originally. Not to mention it cost me 2 group dinners! Literally not ONE person left Mariel ever wanting to return. We were all VERY DISAPPOINTED. Tiny portions of sub par food, more like half orders at other places. It was a mostly bare plate. I didn't take pics but noticed others had, so you can see for yourself   \n",

The staff is very friendly and accommodating.   The menu is diverse so there is something for everyone and they have several weekly specials so it doesn't get boring.  We mostly enjoy the friendly atmosphere\\nName: Tipico Dominicano; Review: Great place, the food was amazing and they are very friendly\\nName: Tony C’s Seaport; Review: If I could give 0 stars I would. We were staying in the hotel right next door and were looking for a family friendly restaurants as we had three kids with us. There was nobody waiting outside so we thought we would get right in. We walked in, the host took a second to look around (at the plenty of empty tables) and then told us there were 3 or 4 groups ahead of us and there would be a wait. I asked about how long, and he couldn’t give me an answer, just 3 or 4 groups. Don’t you know as a host how many people are waiting? I feel they did not want the children in there and it was very unprofessional and we felt unwelcome. We ended up at the restaurant right across the way and witnessed several people walk in and be seated immediately the entire time we were dining. Would definitely not recommend!! Don’t say you are a family friendly restaurant when you steer families away\\nName: Fenway Johnnies; Review: OPEN:  That's a keyword these days, as restaurants try to re-coup from the pandemic. HIGHLY RECOMMEND Fenway Johnnie's - it re-opened this week - after 4 months shuttered - and I couldn't wait to get back. I always feel welcomed here.  LOCATION: Only steps from Fenway Park, here you can get real food before or after a Red Sox Game. Great lounge atmosphere plus bar seating with some good seating in the additional dining room. Lots of big TVs, sports posters and artwork surround the rooms. Not just bar food, but a choice of entrees make Johnnie's a little different, and a little better than neighboring restaurants.  FOOD: Probably the best tasting salmon dinner I have had in a long while.  Preparation is key, and this entree was done right - not hard or over-cooked - this Pan seared salmon came with Lyonnaise potatoes, and green beans served with a great lemon beurre-blanc sauce. Delicious!  DRINKS:  Best beer and liquor selection - a full bar - with bartenders who know how to make a great cocktail. Igor and Dana stand out.  FAMILY:  Johnnie's is large enough to bring your family or friends for a get-together near Fenway Park. The tables are big, with enough room for everyone. Best yet, you will always be treated like family here  - from  the Johnnie's  family. Treat yourself and family to some of the best restaurant service in Boston - friendly, professional and sharp. As I keep saying: \"I love it here\"\\nName: Barney's Grill; Review: Rude rude and more rude. Owner or manager whatever he is doesn't know the first thing about customer service. This man treated my family bad. Stay away. Plenty of other great restaurants around   \n",

It didn't matter. The chicken was phenomenal. GO HERE! Easily the best Korean fried chicken we've had in Boston. Incredibly cheap for the price, with generous portions at 10 pieces for ~$11. We tried their Secret Spicy and the Gang-Jeong, and both were wonderful in their own right (and perfectly cooked). But the real star came on a repeat visit when we got the Hot and Spicy (which was not on the menu the first time we went). We were hoping for spicy chicken and GOOD GOD we were rewarded. This was incredibly spicy and it didn't matter one bit. The chicken was moist and incredibly flavorful, and the sauce hit that perfect note of sweet, savory, and searingly spicy. This is really not chicken for the faint of heart, but for those feeling brave, give it a shot. It's wonderful.  Can't wait to get more from them\\nName: Chicked's Chicken & Grill; Review: Very bad tasting food. I asked for nothing spicy and the woman said it wasn't spicy and that the chicken sandwich comes with mayo,lettuce and tomato. I asked for no tomato. I waited a  30 mins to get a sandwich with hot sauce on i\\nName: Hot Eastern; Review: The service was superb! The server was very nice and gave me the menu with lots of pictures. I ordered a seafood mala bang that was moderately spicy. It was just right. I can eat pretty spicy and I think their spicy scale is appropriate (unlike some Thai restaurants...You order a mild spicy dish and next thing you know you turn into a dragon blowing up flames.) The dumplings appetizer was also good.   I gave this place a four stars because I had a sense that the food is not entirely authentic. I came all the way from San Diego and this place was advertised as Szechuan authentic restaurant. I would appreciate if the menu would indicate which dishes are particularly *authentic*. :\\nName: Sichuan Gourmet Billerica; Review: Best Restaurant in Billerica. You might at first be thrown off by this tiny restaurant's appearance, crammed in a tiny strip mall with a liquor store and a laundromat, but don't let that fool you. Sichuan Gourmet has, hands down, the best food in Billerica, and for Chinese food beats any of the Chinatown places I've been to. The trick is to not order typical \"American\" Chinese dishes like Beef and Broccoli or Sweet and Sour Chicken, which are not very good here, -- the dishes you've never heard of are going to be the best.  I should at this point mention that because the cuisine is from the Sichuan region, much of their food is spicy. Unlike many places, when they put those pepper symbols on the menu, they mean it. However, the spiciness is never a raw overpowering burning -- they dishes carefully balance \"Ma\" (a tingly, electric sensation), \"La\" (spicy), and \"Tang\" (a hot burning sensation) with sweet and savory flavors that can convert many people who think they hate spicy food. They aren't just adding cayenne to their dishes like so many other places do. They also have plenty of non-spicy dishes, and are happy to make any of their menu items less spicy.  For spicy dishes, my favorites are the \"Pork and Eggplant with Yu Xiang Sauce\" which appears on their separate specials menu (it has perfect balance of spicy sauce, sweet eggplant, and savory pork), the Dan Dan Noodles (which the waiter should warn you need to be mixed before eating), any of the \"with Spicy Chili Sauce\" dishes (which are meat or fish served in a red spicy sauce with Napa Cabbage), the \"Old Sichuan Chicken\" (a dried fried chicken with an interesting crust -- the house specialty), the \"Gangou Dry Fish Filet\" (similar to the Old Sichuan Chicken but with fish), the \"Sliced Roast Beef & Tendon w. Chili Sauce\" (if you like tendon), and the \"Hot & Sour Wonton Soup\" (listed under \"Sichuan Delicacies\" not \"Soup\", and very different from a typical Americanized Hot & Sour).  For non-spicy dishes, I would recommend the Scallion Pancake (the only Americanized appetizer I would recommend here),\"Sichuan Cold Noodles - none spicy\" (cold noodles in a vinegary peanut sauce), \"Sichuan Style String Beans\" (a Sichuan classic, and done very well here), \"Meat Ball Sichuan Style\" (A soup-like hot pot with huge meatballs and lots of vegetables), and the Sesame Sweet Potato Cakes (A hot soft sweet-potato pancake that is stuffed with a sweet bean paste, coated in sesame seeds, and drizzled with a sweet sauce).  This restaurant also has fancier locations in Framingham and Brookline, but the food is much better in Billerica.

       "109  Name: Wen's noodle and Ramen 过桥米线; Review: Contrary to prior reviews, the service was excellent. Also, the tip wasn't added when I used my card until I added it, so I don't know what that review was about. It seemed pretty authentic to me. I had the tonkatsu ramen with a few add-ons. I was disappointed there wasn't a spicy option, but there were three spicy condiments on the table that helped me make it spicy. It's not my favorite ramen place in Boston, but I'm glad I visited\\nName: Hot Pot Buffet; Review: One of the worst hot pot places I ever been and I have been to a few. First the price is 24 for dinner which is really good all you can eat. From there everything else is horrible their seafood in the menu are disgusting they are so old and spoiled they smell horrible and all the seafood is covered what looks like dirt. Looks like brown pieces all over almost all the seafood. Also the seafood taste really frezzer burned. As for there meats I had beef tongue I cooked it for less than 4 seconds in the hotpot it was rubber I felt like I was eating piece of tire. The rest of their meat was just ok nothing special. As for their broth horrible as well I had the spicy broth with their house special. As for their spicy broth their was no spice it just looked spicy,my wife hates spicy food she tried the broth and said u sure they gave you the spicy food and their house special broth was from the sink we thought had no flavor tasted like water from the drain. I really dont care how a place looks like usually but this place was so dirty and so disgusting I felt I need a tetanus shot after\\nName: Sichuan Gourmet Billerica; Review: Best Restaurant in Billerica. You might at first be thrown off by this tiny restaurant's appearance, crammed in a tiny strip mall with a liquor store and a laundromat, but don't let that fool you. Sichuan Gourmet has, hands down, the best food in Billerica, and for Chinese food beats any of the Chinatown places I've been to. The trick is to not order typical \"American\" Chinese dishes like Beef and Broccoli or Sweet and Sour Chicken, which are not very good here, -- the dishes you've never heard of are going to be the best.  I should at this point mention that because the cuisine is from the Sichuan region, much of their food is spicy. Unlike many places, when they put those pepper symbols on the menu, they mean it. However, the spiciness is never a raw overpowering burning -- they dishes carefully balance \"Ma\" (a tingly, electric sensation), \"La\" (spicy), and \"Tang\" (a hot burning sensation) with sweet and savory flavors that can convert many people who think they hate spicy food. They aren't just adding cayenne to their dishes like so many other places do. They also have plenty of non-spicy dishes, and are happy to make any of their menu items less spicy.  For spicy dishes, my favorites are the \"Pork and Eggplant with Yu Xiang Sauce\" which appears on their separate specials menu (it has perfect balance of spicy sauce, sweet eggplant, and savory pork), the Dan Dan Noodles (which the waiter should warn you need to be mixed before eating), any of the \"with Spicy Chili Sauce\" dishes (which are meat or fish served in a red spicy sauce with Napa Cabbage), the \"Old Sichuan Chicken\" (a dried fried chicken with an interesting crust -- the house specialty), the \"Gangou Dry Fish Filet\" (similar to the Old Sichuan Chicken but with fish), the \"Sliced Roast Beef & Tendon w. Chili Sauce\" (if you like tendon), and the \"Hot & Sour Wonton Soup\" (listed under \"Sichuan Delicacies\" not \"Soup\", and very different from a typical Americanized Hot & Sour).  For non-spicy dishes, I would recommend the Scallion Pancake (the only Americanized appetizer I would recommend here),\"Sichuan Cold Noodles - none spicy\" (cold noodles in a vinegary peanut sauce), \"Sichuan Style String Beans\" (a Sichuan classic, and done very well here), \"Meat Ball Sichuan Style\" (A soup-like hot pot with huge meatballs and lots of vegetables), and the Sesame Sweet Potato Cakes (A hot soft sweet-potato pancake that is stuffed with a sweet bean paste, coated in sesame seeds, and drizzled with a sweet sauce).  This restaurant also has fancier locations in Framingham and Brookline, but the food is much better in Billerica. If you're looking for authentic or spicy food, it's worth the drive\\nName: Sichuan Gourmet Billerica; Review: Best Restaurant in Billerica.

When you compare it to other fast-casual chains like Cava, Sweet Green, or Chipotle, it's definitely more \"bare bones\" and less fancy. They definitely don't have a \"health\" equity and they don't have many options. But dang this place is delicious. I always get the regular combo platter which comes with beef and chicken, yellow rice, lettuce, and tomatoes. It's also a significant portion for the price which I appreciate.  Servers are friendly but there's not much seating so better to-go than eat-in.  Come in for a quick bite and get the white sauce and a little spicy (it's VERY spicy and I tend to like spicy)  Share review Write an update Edit revie   \n",

Won't be the last. The bartender was very friendly. I ordered an appetizer, buffalo wing dings & a side salad (to go). The portion sizes were huge & the salad was very fresh. The atmosphere was great. It wasn't very busy but it had a warm, cozy feeling to it. I look forward to going back\\nName: The Hen House Wings 'n Waffles; Review: Ordered from here using the Caviar app. Bad decision  I ordered potato skins and the appetizer sampler. The potato skins were either over cooked or not cooked enough because they were hard in some spots and chewy. They tasted like they had been sitting under a light all day with melted cheese and bacon added right before I ordered them. The chicken tenders were over cooked for sure. Super hard and tasted like cardboard. The chicken wings had absolutely no flavor. The only thing that tasted halfway decent was the mozzarella sticks, but they were pretty oily and greasy. I wasted $25 for sure\\nName: Crave Chinatown; Review: Really good! Love how they have an extensive menu that tastes fresh and looks amazing! They also have a drinks menu that includes beer, martinis, cocktails, shots, and a scorpion bowl. Decently large place with decent space in between tables. Service is good but it can get busy on the weekends. People ranging from young to old come here and it's always lively! Bathrooms are in the back which are clean. Separate bathrooms for male and female. 1) Truffle fries with parmesan cheese - really good! Would definitely recommend. Warm and fresh. Super crunchy on the outside and soft potato on the inside. Comes with ketchup and chipotle mayo. Tip: dip the French fries in both sauces at the same time - tastes really good!! Rating: (5/5). 2) Fried rice with egg & chicken - a little too Americanized for me. Standard fried rice. Could use more seasoning overall. Rating: (2/5). 3) Salmon & Tuna Dumplings - REALLY good. It's basically shredded crabmeat and small chunks of lobster wrapped in raw salmon or raw tuna to look like a dumpling. Each dumpling is placed on a large spoon that has a ton of soy sauce on the bottom. The dumplings could do withOUT the soy sauce though. I would have preferred the soy sauce to be on the side so you could control how much soy sauce you're consuming. Regardless, it was still really good and would recommend. The dish includes 4 dumplings for $15. Rating: (4/5). 4) Hotate Hokkaiyaki - baked sea scallop in a large shell with crabmeat tobiko, enoki mushrooms, scallions topped with cheese and spicy mayo served sizzling on a burner. It looks cool and tastes good and fresh! But probably wouldn't get it again. Too much shredded crabmeat and you could really taste the mayo. However I couldn't taste the cheese (which I'm thankful for tbh). An interesting dish though. Dish costed $13. Rating: (4/5). 5) Fried Chicken - size: medium, which consisted of 10 drumsticks. There are around 6 different flavours on believe. We got Soy Garlic and Angry. Soy garlic is mild while Angry has a spicy kick to it (Sriracha spicy level). Chicken was super juicy and decently sized! The fried breading was really good - crunchy, well flavored, and not too oily. Would definitely recommend the soy garlic and definitely the fried chicken. Rating: (5/5)\\nName: Domenic's; Review: 4 stars. Food was great, fabulous eggplant appetizer, meatballs were terrific.  Great presentation of chicken piccata with roasted  brussels sprouts and êxcellent potatoes. Interesting pâsta shapes w chicken parm. Nice fresh Caesar salad. A variety of cocktails...I liked the one with hibiscus. Only thing missing : no coffee & đêssert, but they are pretty nêw, maybe that will come in time, but in the North End, those never far away. Sorry I didn't take pictures of the food. Service was very attentive. I will go back   \n",

We also had appetizers, mine being a short rib egg roll and while it was delicious, it was so heavy. Too heavy before sitting down for ages. Otherwise, this is a pretty nice place to go to for after-work cocktails or even to host a small birthday celebration\\nName: The Boston Shaker; Review: This shop ROCKS! I am just getting into cocktails, and Boston Shaker is EXACTLY the spot I need to put together a world-class bar. You can buy their pre-made kits (that don't include the liquor), or they're more than happy to give you recommendations on which stirring spoon is right for you. They have an INSANE amount of bitters, too, so make sure you try them (mix in with the soda water they have available). Also, books and cocktail recipes galore! And cocktail making classes\\nName: Minibar; Review: The interior decor and specialty cocktails made this bar very Miami-esque. I found the drink prices reasonable, because I don't mind paying for creative concoctions with a kick. But I bet others would find them overpriced. The actual bar is quite small so I'd imagine it takes a little while to get a drink when the place is crowded. But overall I would recommend this lounge-style location for its ambiance and fun liquors\\nName: Bar 10; Review: Great service, great food, great beer and cocktails. Friendly bartender went out of his way to be available and accomodate my requests (ordering room service-only food at the bar, asking for a cocktail recommendation). Highly recommended. Medium price point\\nName: Explorateur Cafe, Restaurant & Bar; Review: I was at Exploratuer last Saturday with my wife before a Christmas party. We both had cocktails,  she an Espresso Martini and I had an L Street Informant. Both cocktails were spot on and delicious.  Fast forward to this past Thursday, I went back in for a beer before an event I had to go to. The bar tender remembered me  and the cocktail that I had and asked if I wanted another. Pretty impressive for such a busy place.  The guys were slammed on Thursday afternoon. They were spot on making detailed drinks flawlessly.  Most impressive is the quality of the bartenders and second to that is quality of the ingredients.  My go to place for a good beer or outstanding drink when I'm in the area.  The cafe offers great pastries to bring home. Never been let down. The kids who work there seem like Political Science majors; but with $12.00 bucks an hour coming their way - nothing can stop them now.  Check this place out   \n",

Late-night food is in desperately short supply in Boston, particularly decent sit-down civilized restaurant style. This was a great find.  I had the Salad D'Parma with steak tips, he the Fettuccine Alfredo with chicken and broccoli - both were excellent. We also appreciated the waitress regularly checking in that everything was going well.  Glad to now have a great goto in East Boston\\nName: Linguine's Italian Eatery; Review: My go-to lunch spot in Marlboro. They have great pasta dishes, subs (love the chicken parmesan!), pizza, and traditional Italian chicken/veal dishes. I usual get a salad that can be topped with grilled chicken, but they will slice a breaded chicken breast instead upon request. The homemade house thick creamy Italian dressing is the best I've found anywhere, and they serve everything with warm pizza dough rolls. Even watching carbs, I can't help but dip a roll in the dressing.  My other favorite lunch is in the winter, they often have either chicken escarole or escarole bean soup (larger bowl). Both are packed with chicken/veggies/beans.  During the day, you order at the counter, and seat yourself. I believe they have wait service at night. I look forward to the days I work in Marlboro just for the Linguine's lunch\\nName: Alfredo's Italian Kitchen/SOUTH BOSTON; Review: Okay, our first night in Boston we looked up places to get great Italian food. Yelp rated this place as far and they were like over a thousand reviews so of course that's where we headed. Little did we know that it's just a stand on the corner of two streets and it's only pick up or carry out, we had no clue. So we left that place on our first night although the menu looked phenomenal and the smell was amazing. However The night before we left we returned and picked up some pizza. It was delicious. I think if I lived in Boston or had more time in Boston I would have been there more frequently. It did look like there were several little shops like this one, this one was just near our b&b and caught our attention. As long as you're okay with just take out or delivery, this is a place I would recommend\\nName: Artu; Review: I try not to eat at the same restaurant twice in the North End, but Artu may need an exemption from this rule. My date and I both agreed that the food was fantastic Sat night. Appetizer was a ricotta wrapped in eggplant, for dinner she ordered the Fusilli e Salsicce con Broccoli Rabe with Sausage and I got the Pollo Arrabiata. The appetizer was definitely the highlight of the evening. For dinner: pasta was perfectly cooked, my chicken dish was spicy, sauces were not too thick/watery and the portions were a reasonable size (nothing left for lunch the next day). No valet parking for Artu, I valeted my car @Mamma Maria for $25. I'd highly recommend\\nName: 5 North Square; Review: We had a delightful lunch of individual real Italian pizzas.  The dough was thin, ingredients fresh, service good and attentive.  Wine list adequate.  Nice street view with plenty local color.  Complimentary bread to dip in seasoned oil was a nice touch   \n",

I think Chipotle, but with sushi. Fish was fresh, sauces were delicious, and my order was accurate. I ordered online, and the pickup was seamless. There's not much seating in the restaurant itself, it shares a spot with a defunct Dunkin Donuts and a sub shop. Definitely not a place you'd want to go if you want to sit down and have a meal, but it's excellent if you want a quick little lunch on your break at work. I'm glad I found it! Definitely get the crispy garlic on top\\nName: State Street Sushi; Review: The sushi was fresh - but not exceptional. Basically a very high grade of supermarket sushi made quickly and at a reasonable price. There are only 4 seats at the counter, but most people seem to get carryout anyway! Our order took about 5 minutes after it was placed and the line moved along quickly. Also, if you're pressed for time, they have pre-made trays. The lunch specials are definitely the best value\\nName: Snappy Sushi; Review: <There is no sushi restaurant series in Boston.> March 17 travel destination visit. There are also shops that are not Japanese-owned sushi shops in the US, so make sure that the manager is Japanese before visiting. On the 1st floor, the group customers were main, so sushi was only at the BF counter. Beer will only be Samuel Adams Boston Lager since he came to Boston ❗ The knob is kimchi tofu. However, cold tofu that came out is what tofu! Well, why not silk? The craftsman was Mexican, but this is the reality of an American sushi restaurant.  It was cold and I was also inspired by the ramen that was on the menu, but after all I could not eat sushi and my identity as a Japanese would be lost. I asked for Spicy Scallop Roll to try a little different species.  I paid attention to the arrangement because I love scallops, but with a medium finish, I managed to recover tofu. Accounting is $ 31.99 without tip.\\nName: T Sushi & Noodles; Review: Although at first it would seem like a very simple sushi stand, you would be surprised by how fresh and tasty their rolls are (Spicy salmon)!! They also have a BOGO 50% off from 4-8 pm. Now I can have a great sushi on a work day\\nName: Douzo Sushi; Review: Another sushi place in my US stay. This place is very close to Boston Back Bay Station, so you can get there very easily and it is not very far from the downtown.  The restaurant is somehow big, when you first enter through two doors, staff will attend you and take you to your sitting. They have both table and lounge areas, so maybe they will ask you which one you prefer, as I was one person I chose to sit down in the bar area.  The bar area has the typical bar, with some tall chairs and small tables for two people ( they can be grouped ) and some TV screens with sports or random stuff.  There are some kinds of Sake and Japanese beer, other than the usual ones. In the menu I only looked for sushi-style food, there are sushi, rolls, maki and sashimi among others.  I chose some with tuna, salmon and yellowfish, and they were very fresh and tasty. It's not the best sushi I've ever had, but it was really good, it was prepared when ordered.  The wasabi was also very good, it mixed really well with the soy sauce and the flavour was awesome, very spicy tho.  The service was also very good, I asked for some advice and what they recommend me was the best ( Yellowfish )   \n",

I had a chicken gordita, pupusas and a chicken enchilada and all were tasty! The papas locas/ crazy fries were so good! My husband had the mixed fajitas and enjoyed them. Highly recommended this restaurant just like mom's yummy cooking\\nName: Taqueria y Pupuseria Mi Ranchito; Review: Welcome to the area I Been waiting on ur place to open And I try it i love Spanish and Mexican food so this is a great fit for me i had the Nacho and it was extremely  good was enough for 2 which I couldn't eat the whole plate...again welcome to the area and I will see you agai\\nName: Qdoba Mexican Eats; Review: An American version of Chinese food. Prices are standard takeout. It's far from classic Mexica\\nName: Emilianoz Mexican Grill; Review: I order out from here about every other week, and I'm never disappointed. The service is great - kind, quick, helpful - and the food is delicious for a small take-out spot in Medford. Their guacamole and salsa are delicious, as well as the Chicken Enchiladas Mole and Verdes. Their Chicken Taco Placero is also a great option. They also have a lot of vegetarian options, including fish tacos, black bean burritos, chilaquiles, etc. Priced affordably as well! Highly recommen   \n",

       "105  Name: Gaslight; Review: We come here for our anniversary, and the service we receive is enough to keep us coming back every year.  I just add a little note notifying them of the occasion, and the entire staff seemed to know (in a positive way).  What blew my mind was when we arrived, without a word to the bartender, they directed us to the bar to wait for our table.  The bartender already knew who we were and handed us two glasses of champagne and wished us a happy anniversary with a smile.  This really impressed me, it was so seamless.  After a short while they brought us to the table.  The waiters we have had are always some of the best I have had in Boston, although we admittedly do not dine out like this very often.  The food is always amazing.  French onion soup split for 2 is the way to go every time.  In recent times we have had the steak, the duck, and the mussles.  All were fantastic.  Sitting outside on a nice evening is wonderful as well, as long as it is decently warm.  (they do have heaters!)  This is a great spot for a special occasion!!\\nName: Orfano; Review: Visited for my anniversary this weekend, at the recommendation of a friend.  Everything about this restaurant is stellar. The decor was sleek and intimate, the service was fantastic, and the food was exquisite.  Started with the mozzarella and garlic bread, followed by the cacio e pepe and pasta with squash. Main entree was lamb and lasagna. Finished up with the gelato and chocolate cake.  Everything was cooked to perfection; the handmade pasta and olive oil and salt vanilla gelato were standouts in my opinion. Pasta portions are small, so you will need to order a main to accompany them.  Smaller wine menu, but what they offer is high quality and you should be able to find something that suits you. They offered a great recommendation for my meal that I was very satisfied with.  Service was prompt and attentive. We were never wanting for anything, and left completely satisfied.  Not insanely expensive for what it is; a perfect bit of a splurge for a special event\\nName: Outlook Kitchen; Review: Ayana, Josh and Tatiana You guys made it sure we have time of our life, thank you. It was supposed to be a just an anniversary celebration but you guys turned into the lifetime memory for us, at the same time it became the reminder how wonderful the world is. You guys sure added happiness to our special day. From that one phone call to the reservation at rooftop as guests our evening got better and better. Our server was awesome do was the bartender, thank you (Merissa and Charese) Charese crafted something special for me because I didn’t feel like drinking anything from menu. the view, the ambiance was amazing and we had wonderful time at the rooftop. The dinner fulfilled the expectation, it was one of the best steak we ever had. The dessert made sure we go home satisfied and happy. It was our anniversary but you made us feel that you celebrated for us. The memory will always remain special. My husband joked that if 24 feel like this, now the bar is so high for 25th. Thank you, Tatiana, for coming out to meet us. Josh, you have awesome staff and I cannot wait to come back with my friends soon. - Jay\\nName: Smith & Wollensky; Review: PROS: - EXCELLENT customer service! Made reservations for our 2nd anniversary dinner months ago. Seated quickly (Monday night, so could be because it was slow), and manager was willing to relocate us to one of the more beautiful dining rooms upon request (see CONS/Pro-tip below for more info). A timeless room, filled with history. Greeted with 2 glasses of complimentary champagne to congratulate us for our anniversary, which was a very thoughtful touch. Our waitress, Rudy, was knowledgeable about the castle and entertained us with facts about the Library Room (see pro-tip below) while we enjoyed our meal. - Great, extensive wine and drink list. - Food was SUPERB--I ordered the gorgonzola encrusted steak (applewood smoked bacon, scallions) and my husband ordered 2 bacon-wrapped steak medallions. We shared a lemon-asparagus appetizer. The steaks were FANTASTICALLY juicy, full of flavor, and the high-quality steak knives cut through with minimal effort. The asparagus was cooked to perfection. We finished with their 10-layer chocolate cake, which we were not able to finish by any means (who doesn't love dessert leftovers?), along with coffee. - The manager has a great dry sense of humor :)  CONS (more of a pro-tip): - We were originally seated in the \"main dining room,\" which was really just an extension of the bar/lounge. The other two 1st floor dining rooms (beautiful, historic) were closed for the night, likely because it was a slow Monday evening. Rock music was playing. Better to go on a weekend evening when the other dining rooms are open. Ask to reserve a table in \"The Library Room,\" where you can see beautiful, timeless pieces of America's history all around you as you eat--original flags from before we had 50 states, original hand-painted map of Boston, engraved crown molding with Generals from U.S. battles dating back to 1776!  Pro-tip TD;LR: Worth going regardless of day/time if you want to just enjoy a casual night of steaks, but only go on weekends when they are busy if you want to enjoy a fancier, or more history-filled dinner\\nName: Coach Grill; Review: lovely restaurant for special occasions or when you want to get maybe a little bit dressed up. They have steaks and seafood and I believe possibly lamb. Food was delicious but some items were expensive the steak was expensive and it was just the steak no sides came with it. Side dishes which are good enough to share with least one other person sometimes they don't tell you that and so you end up with a lot of leftovers for the appetizers. Butterscotch bread pudding was very good the lemon sorbet was actually lemon sherbert but still was refreshing after a nice meal and the service was very good they were very attentive. it is a very nice atmosphere. It's not a chain restaurant so you get the feeling of it being a little bit more romantic get a little bit dressed up so you can have a nice evening out   \n",

We were seated promptly. There was a long delay between the point we were ready to order and the point the waitress came to take our orders. Everyone said they enjoyed their plentiful meals, and they were quick to respond with extras we requested. We agreed we would eat here again\\nName: The Social Register; Review: High prices, small portions, and ok food. I visited with a group of 4. The menu suggested that patrons order with the intent to share each dish. We decided to follow the suggestion and each ordered a different item. When the food finally arrived (service was very slow this night, though the table clearing girls were extremely fastidious), we were very disappointed to find that the portions were more suited for 1-2 people. Even more boggling was that dishes were divided into 3 or 5 pieces, clearly the perfect choice for a 'shareable' dish. If this was called out in the menu we would have known and not ordered. For example, the shareable Caeser salad was served in a bowl the size of a normal cereal bowl, thus not nearly enough. If my group was 1 or 2 people, such as a date, 4 dishes would have been enough to satisfy us. With 4 people, 4 dishes just didn't cut it. We found out later by watching other patrons, that ordering burgers or sandwiches was the way to go. Those dishes came out on large plates with heaping helpings of fries along with a large burger. All that for about the same price as any one of the tiny dishes we ordered! Unfortunately we had already spent over $60 on our tiny plates and decided to cut our losses and leave. The server could tell we were unsatisfied with the meal and apologized. We told her that it was mostly the tiny amount of food that made us upset, but the slow service didn't help. The atmosphere was loud and for some reason everything was brass colored. It almost looked like they were going for a steampunk vibe but forgot all the interesting machinery bits. Very blah and dark. So to sum this up, get a burger here if you want a decent amount of food. If you would rather waste your money on small amounts of mediocre food then get the 'social' dishes\\nName: Cafeteria Boston; Review: Cafeteria Boston is one of my favorite restaurants in the city. And just like any other restaurant that I love, I've dined here several times and they NEVER disappoint.  The last time I went here was in late August with three friends. The weather was gorgeous, sunny and warm, versus hot and humid so of course we sat on the patio. Since it was early evening (sometime between 4 and 5pm)  the patio was mostly empty around that time. Upon arrival, it was only myself and my friend that drove us, so we were waiting on our two other friends. Although everyone arrived at different intervals in time, our server was still prompt and checked in with us regularly.  I'm the definition of a social drinker so I ordered one fruity cocktail, the pomegranate martini; then I had the chicken drumsticks with celery and carrot sticks (ALL the sticks) as an appetizer. Soon after our other two friends arrived and so did the rest of Boston as the patio started to fill up quickly.  I was having such a great time catching up with everyone I didn't even notice if there was a lapse between our drinks and food as we dined for several hours. I got the black bean burger as my entree and devoured it and everyone else was super happy with their entree choices as well.  The food and service here are always good will definitely be back soon\\nName: Marlborough Super Buffet; Review: I must say that this is a fun place for a group of people. The food at this place is consistently pretty okay. The food is best around the noon lunch rush and the 6-7pm dinner rush as the options are refreshed regularly.  There are a ton of options to choose from. As with typical Americanized Asian food offerings, you'll find the standard options like spare ribs, chicken with broccoli, rice options, and chicken fingers plus wontons, soup, crawfish and more. Additionally, the dinner menu comes with an option for the hand made sushi that's pretty good!  They're are also options for the fussy eating underage crowd: chicken tenders, pizza, french fries and the like.  It's not fine dining, but it's a great place for a good meal\\nName: Belly Buster Diner; Review: Came here yesterday with my daughter and a friend, it was our first time and I've heard great things about this place. The food is amazing!! I got a veggie omelette and it was huge. I couldn't even finish everything on my plate because the portions are so big. Great atmosphere, big portions of food, delicious food and amazing prices. I highly recommend coming here especially if you haven't tried it yet. Belly Busters is our go to place from now on   \n",

I like to go there because they have good food and delicious drinks. They also have great service for people who come to the restaurant. Lastly, the seating area where you eat is entertaining and comfortable.  I like the 99 because they have great food.I love their ribs because they are juicy and tender. The macaroni and cheese is delightful. It is always hot and cheesy. Are you a big baseball fan? If so, when the Red Sox win kids eat for free. Great news grown ups, you don't have to pay  They have drinks that no one can live without. The pink lemonade is awesome. It is really refreshing to drink. You can get as many free refills as you want. You can also ask for a different drink.  They even have root beer that taste like icecream. With so many options, you won't have a problem finding a drink that you like.  The waitresses are nice and give good service. Before you order they give you popcorn. If you are very hungry then eat some popcorn,  but warning do not spoil your dinner. They bring out the food fast and make sure you have everything you need at the table. At the end, they give the kids an ice cream sandwich.  Lastly, I like the 99 because of the seating area the chairs are comfortable and fluffy. You can watch any kind of sports games. They have Celtics Pictures on the the wall. If you get bored then watch tv and eat more popcorn.  I hope you visit the 99 and experience the food and drinks, the service,  and the seating area that I love about the restaurant. Reader don't forget kids get free food when the red sox win.  - Written by Quentin M., a third grader at the BTU Schoo\\nName: Stelio's Family Restaurant; Review: Been driving by this place for years, but always had a doubt because the mixed reviews. Finally gave it a try as part of our try something new in the area. We went for lunch on Saturday at 12:30. The parking lot is full as there was a baby shower going on in the function room. It pretty decent American style with a good mix of classic and new dishes. We ordered veritirs of dishes, Fish Chowder, BBQ Ribs, Baked Haddock , Roasted Lamb, for us, and pasta and chicken fingers for kids. The chowder had a hearty taste, good for a cold day. The ribs were St Louis style, fall of the bone tender. The baked haddock was very tender, the light touch of butter made the fish very smooth. The baked lamb is tomato based, it could use a kick of flavor. Kids meals are large potion and pretty standard. Overall, pretty nice place, would come again. The inside of the restaurant was renovated last year compare to some old photos. It has a bit of modern touch now\\nName: Family Affair Restaurant; Review: I work at Northeastern University and the food for an event that I was attending was catered by family affair. I promise you all 50 of us raved about the food! Fried chicken sooo good! Mac and cheese sooo good! BBQ pulled pork, bomb too! Oh and the jerk chicken was yummy too! The food your restaurant provided was exceptional! Looking forward to visiting the restaurant on my own\\nName: Family Affair Restaurant; Review: I’m always in the lookup you try new restaurant. I walked into the restaurant and the smell of the food was amazing. I was greeted by the owner and I ordered the oxtail dinner. The meat was so tender and full of flavor and the mashed potatoes and Mac and cheese were delicious. The owner walked to my table and offer me a free lemonade drink. A must try restaurant. A Must try food\\nName: Tony C’s Seaport; Review: If I could give 0 stars I would. We were staying in the hotel right next door and were looking for a family friendly restaurants as we had three kids with us. There was nobody waiting outside so we thought we would get right in. We walked in, the host took a second to look around (at the plenty of empty tables) and then told us there were 3 or 4 groups ahead of us and there would be a wait. I asked about how long, and he couldn’t give me an answer, just 3 or 4 groups. Don’t you know as a host how many people are waiting? I feel they did not want the children in there and it was very unprofessional and we felt unwelcome. We ended up at the restaurant right across the way and witnessed several people walk in and be seated immediately the entire time we were dining. Would definitely not recommend!! Don’t say you are a family friendly restaurant when you steer families away   \n",

The taste is ok, but the Hunan cuisine has been improved. Jintang fat beef pickled pepper taste is too light, sour and spicy appetizers can not be done. The chopped peppers in the chopped pepper fish head looked much, but in fact there was nothing spicy. Look at Fuzhou cuisine like this.\\nName: Chicked's Chicken & Grill; Review: Very bad tasting food.

Just about everything on the menu is excellent... not something I say about many places. Every time we decide to try something new, we are almost never disappointed. The food here has been consistently excellent over a considerable period of time. They are hard workers, friendly people and they provide excellent food when you are in the mood for Thai cuisine. Definitely, give them a try\\nName: Chilli Thai Bistro; Review: REALLY good Thai food!! Love it. Wish i lived around here so i could frequent this place.

Like the main waitress was kind of rude may be she had a long day. Food I would say was ok. I would suggest never try lamb or goat because the meat is never tender this is my second experience. I ordered a goat biryani. There were tiny tiny bones so it was really uncomfortable to eat, I ate just two spoons and gave up, well goat and lamb is with bones but tiny bones are really risky if you swallow you might get choked. Biryani was I would say atleast a week old ( easily figures out with the taste and size of the rice grain) was very spicy, the masala was not in proportion. Goan curry was amazing loved the taste. Nan was ok no complains. Kachori chat was also ok.  One more thing I was not sure of they already add tips which I guess was 15% and do they expect us to write more tips because below of the invoice there was suggestion for tips. Not sure. Overall I would give one more try and see if they can make some changes   \n",

I had to ask for two things again because they overlooked what I wrote on the menu that you're supposed to fill out. Also, the container on tables where skewers are thrown out need to be cleaned! The servers just remove the empty skewers and leave the dirty containers for next customers. I was appalled, looked so disgusting.  Also, the staff need to learn how to say thank you or sorry when they miss something. I was actually afraid to ask for water towards the end\\nName: Mumbai Spice; Review: Not a big fan of writting negative stuff. But unfriendly staff. Like the main waitress was kind of rude may be she had a long day. Food I would say was ok. I would suggest never try lamb or goat because the meat is never tender this is my second experience. I ordered a goat biryani. There were tiny tiny bones so it was really uncomfortable to eat, I ate just two spoons and gave up, well goat and lamb is with bones but tiny bones are really risky if you swallow you might get choked. Biryani was I would say atleast a week old ( easily figures out with the taste and size of the rice grain) was very spicy, the masala was not in proportion. Goan curry was amazing loved the taste. Nan was ok no complains. Kachori chat was also ok.  One more thing I was not sure of they already add tips which I guess was 15% and do they expect us to write more tips because below of the invoice there was suggestion for tips. Not sure. Overall I would give one more try and see if they can make some changes\\nName: China Gourmet Restaurant; Review: Totally not spicy. The taste is ok, but the Hunan cuisine has been improved. Jintang fat beef pickled pepper taste is too light, sour and spicy appetizers can not be done. The chopped peppers in the chopped pepper fish head looked much, but in fact there was nothing spicy. Look at Fuzhou cuisine like this.\\nName: Chilli Thai Bistro; Review: REALLY good Thai food!! Love it. Wish i lived around here so i could frequent this place. The 3 pepper mark of heat is like 5 pepper mark anywhere else i usually eat. Whew   \n",

Love how they have an extensive menu that tastes fresh and looks amazing! They also have a drinks menu that includes beer, martinis, cocktails, shots, and a scorpion bowl. Decently large place with decent space in between tables. Service is good but it can get busy on the weekends. People ranging from young to old come here and it's always lively! Bathrooms are in the back which are clean. Separate bathrooms for male and female. 1) Truffle fries with parmesan cheese - really good! Would definitely recommend. Warm and fresh. Super crunchy on the outside and soft potato on the inside. Comes with ketchup and chipotle mayo. Tip: dip the French fries in both sauces at the same time - tastes really good!! Rating: (5/5). 2) Fried rice with egg & chicken - a little too Americanized for me. Standard fried rice. Could use more seasoning overall. Rating: (2/5). 3) Salmon & Tuna Dumplings - REALLY good. It's basically shredded crabmeat and small chunks of lobster wrapped in raw salmon or raw tuna to look like a dumpling. Each dumpling is placed on a large spoon that has a ton of soy sauce on the bottom. The dumplings could do withOUT the soy sauce though. I would have preferred the soy sauce to be on the side so you could control how much soy sauce you're consuming. Regardless, it was still really good and would recommend. The dish includes 4 dumplings for $15. Rating: (4/5). 4) Hotate Hokkaiyaki - baked sea scallop in a large shell with crabmeat tobiko, enoki mushrooms, scallions topped with cheese and spicy mayo served sizzling on a burner. It looks cool and tastes good and fresh! But probably wouldn't get it again. Too much shredded crabmeat and you could really taste the mayo. However I couldn't taste the cheese (which I'm thankful for tbh). An interesting dish though. Dish costed $13. Rating: (4/5). 5) Fried Chicken - size: medium, which consisted of 10 drumsticks. There are around 6 different flavours on believe. We got Soy Garlic and Angry. Soy garlic is mild while Angry has a spicy kick to it (Sriracha spicy level). Chicken was super juicy and decently sized! The fried breading was really good - crunchy, well flavored, and not too oily. Would definitely recommend the soy garlic and definitely the fried chicken.

Tonight I got the D'Parma salad, chicken cutlet, roasted red peppers, fresh Mozzarella cheese, cucumbers, tomatoes, red onion and lettuce with amazing house dressing, it was so good.. We also got the shrimp, scallop, crab Ravioli app. It was very small but so good. I Love the amazing fresh baked bread that they serve with oil for dipping.. I load it up with cheese and crush red pepper, its so good. I also love the subs.. the Chicken Parm and Meatball parm are pretty amazing\\n\\nName: Taproom Bar & Grill; Review: Drove out from Milford MA (just a bit over an hour) after googling a place to meet up with a friend. The alcohol drinks were not bad. Our appetizer mozzarella sticks were perfect as was the sauce and the burgers looked so good we didn't even want to touch it. Luckily it tasted as good as it looked. Seems like it had a seasoning to it which put some flavor in it. Those seasoned fries too were amazing. Our waitress with the blonde hair did a great job. Very friendly and attentive. Give her a raise! We will come back agai\\n\\nName: Fool's Errand; Review: I LOVE what they’ve got going here. Chef Faison’s concept is so great here - excellently crafted drinks and just plain-ol great snacks. They’re not afraid to serve you raclette, beautiful bread and fresh whipped butter, nor do they shy away from something bougie like caviar, but they’re not afraid to dish it out with a single-serving size bag of classic Lays chips. I love the juxtaposition! It’s so welcoming, like it’s just great drinks and great snacks and everything is just grounded in what tastes good! Also, highest rated bathroom in Boston by far, so how can one not like this place   \n",

We also had appetizers, mine being a short rib egg roll and while it was delicious, it was so heavy. Too heavy before sitting down for ages. Otherwise, this is a pretty nice place to go to for after-work cocktails or even to host a small birthday celebration\\n\\nName: The Boston Shaker; Review: This shop ROCKS! I am just getting into cocktails, and Boston Shaker is EXACTLY the spot I need to put together a world-class bar. You can buy their pre-made kits (that don't include the liquor), or they're more than happy to give you recommendations on which stirring spoon is right for you. They have an INSANE amount of bitters, too, so make sure you try them (mix in with the soda water they have available). Also, books and cocktail recipes galore! And cocktail making classes\\n\\nName: Minibar; Review: The interior decor and specialty cocktails made this bar very Miami-esque. I found the drink prices reasonable, because I don't mind paying for creative concoctions with a kick. But I bet others would find them overpriced. The actual bar is quite small so I'd imagine it takes a little while to get a drink when the place is crowded. But overall I would recommend this lounge-style location for its ambiance and fun liquors\\n\\nName: Bar 10; Review: Great service, great food, great beer and cocktails. Friendly bartender went out of his way to be available and accomodate my requests (ordering room service-only food at the bar, asking for a cocktail recommendation). Highly recommended. Medium price point\\n\\nName: Explorateur Cafe, Restaurant & Bar; Review: I was at Exploratuer last Saturday with my wife before a Christmas party. We both had cocktails,  she an Espresso Martini and I had an L Street Informant. Both cocktails were spot on and delicious.  Fast forward to this past Thursday, I went back in for a beer before an event I had to go to. The bar tender remembered me  and the cocktail that I had and asked if I wanted another. Pretty impressive for such a busy place.  The guys were slammed on Thursday afternoon. They were spot on making detailed drinks flawlessly.  Most impressive is the quality of the bartenders and second to that is quality of the ingredients.  My go to place for a good beer or outstanding drink when I'm in the area.  The cafe offers great pastries to bring home. Never been let down. The kids who work there seem like Political Science majors; but with $12.00 bucks an hour coming their way - nothing can stop them now.  Check this place out   \n",

They have great pasta dishes, subs (love the chicken parmesan!), pizza, and traditional Italian chicken/veal dishes. I usual get a salad that can be topped with grilled chicken, but they will slice a breaded chicken breast instead upon request. The homemade house thick creamy Italian dressing is the best I've found anywhere, and they serve everything with warm pizza dough rolls. Even watching carbs, I can't help but dip a roll in the dressing.  My other favorite lunch is in the winter, they often have either chicken escarole or escarole bean soup (larger bowl). Both are packed with chicken/veggies/beans.  During the day, you order at the counter, and seat yourself. I believe they have wait service at night. I look forward to the days I work in Marlboro just for the Linguine's lunch\\n\\nName: Alfredo's Italian Kitchen/SOUTH BOSTON; Review: Okay, our first night in Boston we looked up places to get great Italian food. Yelp rated this place as far and they were like over a thousand reviews so of course that's where we headed. Little did we know that it's just a stand on the corner of two streets and it's only pick up or carry out, we had no clue. So we left that place on our first night although the menu looked phenomenal and the smell was amazing. However The night before we left we returned and picked up some pizza. It was delicious. I think if I lived in Boston or had more time in Boston I would have been there more frequently. It did look like there were several little shops like this one, this one was just near our b&b and caught our attention. As long as you're okay with just take out or delivery, this is a place I would recommend\\n\\nName: 5 North Square; Review: We had a delightful lunch of individual real Italian pizzas.  The dough was thin, ingredients fresh, service good and attentive.  Wine list adequate.  Nice street view with plenty local color.  Complimentary bread to dip in seasoned oil was a nice touch\\n\\nName: Maurizio's; Review: My favorite Italian restaurant on Planet Earth. Don't believe me? Try Maurizio's Involtini di Melanzane (rolled slices of eggplant stuffed with ricotta cheese, basil, sun dried tomatoes and parmesan cheese, topped with tomato sauce) as an appetizer, and then the Linguine ai Frutti di Mare (shrimp, scallops, clams, mussels and calamari served in a spicy lobster based tomato sauce and tossed with linguine) as a main course.  Ask Linda to choose a bottle of wine for you. Maurizio's food is proof of the existence of God. Period\\n\\nName: Dino's Cafe; Review: This small little gem in North Boston's Little Italy has to be tasted.  It's more of a take out business then sit down spot, but the place is so quaint and oozes Italian flare, you should grab a seat. You won't get diligent server assistance as they are geared to take out.  But the food is sooo good you won't care.  The chef/cook couldn't be more pleased to have you at Dinos.  I had fettuccine with sausage in garlic cream sauce.  I was offered extra bread for the A+ sauce. Amazing food for some of the BEST prices in Boston.  Try it   \n",

I think Chipotle, but with sushi. Fish was fresh, sauces were delicious, and my order was accurate. I ordered online, and the pickup was seamless. There's not much seating in the restaurant itself, it shares a spot with a defunct Dunkin Donuts and a sub shop. Definitely not a place you'd want to go if you want to sit down and have a meal, but it's excellent if you want a quick little lunch on your break at work. I'm glad I found it! Definitely get the crispy garlic on top\\n\\nName: State Street Sushi; Review: The sushi was fresh - but not exceptional. Basically a very high grade of supermarket sushi made quickly and at a reasonable price. There are only 4 seats at the counter, but most people seem to get carryout anyway! Our order took about 5 minutes after it was placed and the line moved along quickly. Also, if you're pressed for time, they have pre-made trays. The lunch specials are definitely the best value\\n\\nName: Snappy Sushi; Review: <There is no sushi restaurant series in Boston.> March 17 travel destination visit. There are also shops that are not Japanese-owned sushi shops in the US, so make sure that the manager is Japanese before visiting. On the 1st floor, the group customers were main, so sushi was only at the BF counter. Beer will only be Samuel Adams Boston Lager since he came to Boston ❗ The knob is kimchi tofu. However, cold tofu that came out is what tofu! Well, why not silk? The craftsman was Mexican, but this is the reality of an American sushi restaurant.  It was cold and I was also inspired by the ramen that was on the menu, but after all I could not eat sushi and my identity as a Japanese would be lost. I asked for Spicy Scallop Roll to try a little different species.  I paid attention to the arrangement because I love scallops, but with a medium finish, I managed to recover tofu. Accounting is $ 31.99 without tip.\\n\\nName: T Sushi & Noodles; Review: Although at first it would seem like a very simple sushi stand, you would be surprised by how fresh and tasty their rolls are (Spicy salmon)!! They also have a BOGO 50% off from 4-8 pm. Now I can have a great sushi on a work day\\n\\nName: Douzo Sushi; Review: Another sushi place in my US stay. This place is very close to Boston Back Bay Station, so you can get there very easily and it is not very far from the downtown.  The restaurant is somehow big, when you first enter through two doors, staff will attend you and take you to your sitting. They have both table and lounge areas, so maybe they will ask you which one you prefer, as I was one person I chose to sit down in the bar area.  The bar area has the typical bar, with some tall chairs and small tables for two people ( they can be grouped ) and some TV screens with sports or random stuff.  There are some kinds of Sake and Japanese beer, other than the usual ones. In the menu I only looked for sushi-style food, there are sushi, rolls, maki and sashimi among others.  I chose some with tuna, salmon and yellowfish, and they were very fresh and tasty. It's not the best sushi I've ever had, but it was really good, it was prepared when ordered.  The wasabi was also very good, it mixed really well with the soy sauce and the flavour was awesome, very spicy tho.  The service was also very good, I asked for some advice and what they recommend me was the best ( Yellowfish )   \n",

The service is great - kind, quick, helpful - and the food is delicious for a small take-out spot in Medford. Their guacamole and salsa are delicious, as well as the Chicken Enchiladas Mole and Verdes. Their Chicken Taco Placero is also a great option. They also have a lot of vegetarian options, including fish tacos, black bean burritos, chilaquiles, etc. Priced affordably as well! Highly recommen\\n\\nName: Emilianoz Mexican Grill; Review: We eat here about once a week. They have different salsas depending on what's fresh. They are very friendly and it so family owned. The service is excellent. The food is great. The Carne Asada plate is excellent as are their varied tacos, fajitas, flautas, burritos, enchiladas and specialty dishes. The atmosphere is warm ad.

       "105  Name: Gaslight; Review: We come here for our anniversary, and the service we receive is enough to keep us coming back every year.  I just add a little note notifying them of the occasion, and the entire staff seemed to know (in a positive way).  What blew my mind was when we arrived, without a word to the bartender, they directed us to the bar to wait for our table.  The bartender already knew who we were and handed us two glasses of champagne and wished us a happy anniversary with a smile.  This really impressed me, it was so seamless.  After a short while they brought us to the table.  The waiters we have had are always some of the best I have had in Boston, although we admittedly do not dine out like this very often.  The food is always amazing.  French onion soup split for 2 is the way to go every time.  In recent times we have had the steak, the duck, and the mussles.  All were fantastic.  Sitting outside on a nice evening is wonderful as well, as long as it is decently warm.  (they do have heaters!)  This is a great spot for a special occasion!!\\n\\nName: Orfano; Review: Visited for my anniversary this weekend, at the recommendation of a friend.  Everything about this restaurant is stellar. The decor was sleek and intimate, the service was fantastic, and the food was exquisite.  Started with the mozzarella and garlic bread, followed by the cacio e pepe and pasta with squash. Main entree was lamb and lasagna. Finished up with the gelato and chocolate cake.  Everything was cooked to perfection; the handmade pasta and olive oil and salt vanilla gelato were standouts in my opinion. Pasta portions are small, so you will need to order a main to accompany them.  Smaller wine menu, but what they offer is high quality and you should be able to find something that suits you. They offered a great recommendation for my meal that I was very satisfied with.  Service was prompt and attentive. We were never wanting for anything, and left completely satisfied.  Not insanely expensive for what it is; a perfect bit of a splurge for a special event\\n\\nName: Outlook Kitchen; Review: Ayana, Josh and Tatiana You guys made it sure we have time of our life, thank you. It was supposed to be a just an anniversary celebration but you guys turned into the lifetime memory for us, at the same time it became the reminder how wonderful the world is. You guys sure added happiness to our special day. From that one phone call to the reservation at rooftop as guests our evening got better and better. Our server was awesome do was the bartender, thank you (Merissa and Charese) Charese crafted something special for me because I didn’t feel like drinking anything from menu. the view, the ambiance was amazing and we had wonderful time at the rooftop. The dinner fulfilled the expectation, it was one of the best steak we ever had. The dessert made sure we go home satisfied and happy. It was our anniversary but you made us feel that you celebrated for us. The memory will always remain special. My husband joked that if 24 feel like this, now the bar is so high for 25th. Thank you, Tatiana, for coming out to meet us. Josh, you have awesome staff and I cannot wait to come back with my friends soon. - Jay\\n\\nName: Smith & Wollensky; Review: PROS: - EXCELLENT customer service! Made reservations for our 2nd anniversary dinner months ago. Seated quickly (Monday night, so could be because it was slow), and manager was willing to relocate us to one of the more beautiful dining rooms upon request (see CONS/Pro-tip below for more info). A timeless room, filled with history. Greeted with 2 glasses of complimentary champagne to congratulate us for our anniversary, which was a very thoughtful touch. Our waitress, Rudy, was knowledgeable about the castle and entertained us with facts about the Library Room (see pro-tip below) while we enjoyed our meal. - Great, extensive wine and drink list. - Food was SUPERB--I ordered the gorgonzola encrusted steak (applewood smoked bacon, scallions) and my husband ordered 2 bacon-wrapped steak medallions. We shared a lemon-asparagus appetizer. The steaks were FANTASTICALLY juicy, full of flavor, and the high-quality steak knives cut through with minimal effort. The asparagus was cooked to perfection. We finished with their 10-layer chocolate cake, which we were not able to finish by any means (who doesn't love dessert leftovers?), along with coffee. - The manager has a great dry sense of humor :)  CONS (more of a pro-tip): - We were originally seated in the \"main dining room,\" which was really just an extension of the bar/lounge. The other two 1st floor dining rooms (beautiful, historic) were closed for the night, likely because it was a slow Monday evening. Rock music was playing. Better to go on a weekend evening when the other dining rooms are open. Ask to reserve a table in \"The Library Room,\" where you can see beautiful, timeless pieces of America's history all around you as you eat--original flags from before we had 50 states, original hand-painted map of Boston, engraved crown molding with Generals from U.S. battles dating back to 1776!  Pro-tip TD;LR: Worth going regardless of day/time if you want to just enjoy a casual night of steaks, but only go on weekends when they are busy if you want to enjoy a fancier, or more history-filled dinner\\n\\nName: Deuxave; Review: Went for our wedding anniversary.  We were promptly seated at what seemed an especially nice table for 2 with large wingback chairs.  Alas, these big comfy chairs aren’t so well suited to eating; we had to sit up on the edges to eat.  Nothing came to the table for a bit, but then a friendly waiter greeted us with \"welcome back.\"  (Did someone really track that we had eaten there a few years ago?).  We ordered drinks, and our meal.  We were seated a full 45 minutes before our first course came. My wife loved her foie gras; my burrata was a somewhat odd presentation; it was submerged in \"tomato water,\" something not mentioned on the menu, and making it something of a cold soup.  I wouldn’t get it again.  Main courses arrived promptly after that, but our waiter forgot that I had suggested we might like a glass of wine with dinner.  Indeed, where was our waiter?  I asked the server to bring back the wine list; the wines actually arrived when we were a third through our main courses.  My wife’s salmon was terrific; it was very lightly cooked, and she couldn’t finish it, even with help from me.  My rib-eye steak was cooked perfectly, and it was tasty, but didn’t look the least bit like a rib-eye.  It looked like a large cube of sirloin, with little, if any, marbling.  We got dessert menus, and then, we lost our waiter again.  We had to grab the roving hostess to get him to return to the table.  The Dark Chocolate Crèmeux was a memorable dessert.  Great chocolate, and lots of different textures.  As others have noted, this is not an inexpensive restaurant, and while it had several big pluses, the more-than-occasional lapses in service and presentation weren’t up to this high a price tag   \n",

We were seated promptly. There was a long delay between the point we were ready to order and the point the waitress came to take our orders. Everyone said they enjoyed their plentiful meals, and they were quick to respond with extras we requested. We agreed we would eat here again\\n\\nName: The Social Register; Review: High prices, small portions, and ok food. I visited with a group of 4. The menu suggested that patrons order with the intent to share each dish. We decided to follow the suggestion and each ordered a different item. When the food finally arrived (service was very slow this night, though the table clearing girls were extremely fastidious), we were very disappointed to find that the portions were more suited for 1-2 people. Even more boggling was that dishes were divided into 3 or 5 pieces, clearly the perfect choice for a 'shareable' dish. If this was called out in the menu we would have known and not ordered. For example, the shareable Caeser salad was served in a bowl the size of a normal cereal bowl, thus not nearly enough. If my group was 1 or 2 people, such as a date, 4 dishes would have been enough to satisfy us. With 4 people, 4 dishes just didn't cut it. We found out later by watching other patrons, that ordering burgers or sandwiches was the way to go. Those dishes came out on large plates with heaping helpings of fries along with a large burger. All that for about the same price as any one of the tiny dishes we ordered! Unfortunately we had already spent over $60 on our tiny plates and decided to cut our losses and leave. The server could tell we were unsatisfied with the meal and apologized. We told her that it was mostly the tiny amount of food that made us upset, but the slow service didn't help. The atmosphere was loud and for some reason everything was brass colored. It almost looked like they were going for a steampunk vibe but forgot all the interesting machinery bits. Very blah and dark. So to sum this up, get a burger here if you want a decent amount of food. If you would rather waste your money on small amounts of mediocre food then get the 'social' dishes\\n\\nName: Cafeteria Boston; Review: Cafeteria Boston is one of my favorite restaurants in the city. And just like any other restaurant that I love, I've dined here several times and they NEVER disappoint.  The last time I went here was in late August with three friends. The weather was gorgeous, sunny and warm, versus hot and humid so of course we sat on the patio. Since it was early evening (sometime between 4 and 5pm)  the patio was mostly empty around that time. Upon arrival, it was only myself and my friend that drove us, so we were waiting on our two other friends. Although everyone arrived at different intervals in time, our server was still prompt and checked in with us regularly.  I'm the definition of a social drinker so I ordered one fruity cocktail, the pomegranate martini; then I had the chicken drumsticks with celery and carrot sticks (ALL the sticks) as an appetizer. Soon after our other two friends arrived and so did the rest of Boston as the patio started to fill up quickly.  I was having such a great time catching up with everyone I didn't even notice if there was a lapse between our drinks and food as we dined for several hours. I got the black bean burger as my entree and devoured it and everyone else was super happy with their entree choices as well.  The food and service here are always good will definitely be back soon\\n\\nName: Marlborough Super Buffet; Review: I must say that this is a fun place for a group of people. The food at this place is consistently pretty okay. The food is best around the noon lunch rush and the 6-7pm dinner rush as the options are refreshed regularly.  There are a ton of options to choose from. As with typical Americanized Asian food offerings, you'll find the standard options like spare ribs, chicken with broccoli, rice options, and chicken fingers plus wontons, soup, crawfish and more. Additionally, the dinner menu comes with an option for the hand made sushi that's pretty good!  They're are also options for the fussy eating underage crowd: chicken tenders, pizza, french fries and the like.  It's not fine dining, but it's a great place for a good meal\\n\\nName: Belly Buster Diner; Review: Came here yesterday with my daughter and a friend, it was our first time and I've heard great things about this place. The food is amazing!! I got a veggie omelette and it was huge. I couldn't even finish everything on my plate because the portions are so big. Great atmosphere, big portions of food, delicious food and amazing prices. I highly recommend coming here especially if you haven't tried it yet. Belly Busters is our go to place from now on   \n",

I promise you all 50 of us raved about the food! Fried chicken sooo good! Mac and cheese sooo good! BBQ pulled pork, bomb too! Oh and the jerk chicken was yummy too! The food your restaurant provided was exceptional! Looking forward to visiting the restaurant on my own\\n\\nName: Tony C’s Seaport; Review: If I could give 0 stars I would. We were staying in the hotel right next door and were looking for a family friendly restaurants as we had three kids with us. There was nobody waiting outside so we thought we would get right in. We walked in, the host took a second to look around (at the plenty of empty tables) and then told us there were 3 or 4 groups ahead of us and there would be a wait. I asked about how long, and he couldn’t give me an answer, just 3 or 4 groups. Don’t you know as a host how many people are waiting? I feel they did not want the children in there and it was very unprofessional and we felt unwelcome. We ended up at the restaurant right across the way and witnessed several people walk in and be seated immediately the entire time we were dining. Would definitely not recommend!! Don’t say you are a family friendly restaurant when you steer families away\\n\\nName: Little Asia Restaurant; Review: The place is great for a family or if you just need a quick bite and a beer. Their food is always a top go to but a secret weapon of theirs is the chinese pizza. I'm not sure it's on their online menu but just ask, they're awesome. The staff has always been very friendly, they get to know you quick and treat you like you've been going forever. Now with Covid they have barriers between tables and seem to be taking the situation seriously. They have a bar area and a variety of drinks (man's mai tai is always my go to), keno if you want to kill time while waiting. Would definitely suggest trying if you haven'\\n\\nName: Sportello; Review: CHILD FRIENDLY! Can't say enough about this place.  Hadn't been in a couple years and wasn't sure what to expect. My 3yr old was tantruming as we walked in and multiple staff immediately came over to offer bread, suggest firing a child's pasta dish, and bring a coloring book with crayons. Server mentioned dessert without saying the word and told me I didn't need to apologize for my son.  And when I asked for an espresso before leaving it arrived within a 2 minutes. Arguably best service I've ever had.  The food was awesome.  Octopus carpaccio was inventive and delicious (and portion was almost a meal in itself). The shrimp and corn cappaletti was good and creative,  although I didn't love that the filling was a mousse. Dish was well executed though.  My son's tagliatelle with butter was beautiful. Tagliatelle was so delicate and the butter was more of a butter emulsion\\n\\nName: Roza Lyons; Review: Great place to bring the family for a meal or a couple friends for drinks.  The staff is very friendly and accommodating.   The menu is diverse so there is something for everyone and they have several weekly specials so it doesn't get boring.  We mostly enjoy the friendly atmosphere   \n",

The taste is ok, but the Hunan cuisine has been improved. Jintang fat beef pickled pepper taste is too light, sour and spicy appetizers can not be done. The chopped peppers in the chopped pepper fish head looked much, but in fact there was nothing spicy. Look at Fuzhou cuisine like this.\\n\\nName: Chicked's Chicken & Grill; Review: Very bad tasting food. I asked for nothing spicy and the woman said it wasn't spicy and that the chicken sandwich comes with mayo,lettuce and tomato. I asked for no tomato. I waited a  30 mins to get a sandwich with hot sauce on i\\n\\nName: Spice & Pepper; Review: Excellent Asian cuisine in a non-descript location. Just about everything on the menu is excellent... not something I say about many places. Every time we decide to try something new, we are almost never disappointed. The food here has been consistently excellent over a considerable period of time. They are hard workers, friendly people and they provide excellent food when you are in the mood for Thai cuisine. Definitely, give them a try\\n\\nName: Chilli Thai Bistro; Review: REALLY good Thai food!! Love it. Wish i lived around here so i could frequent this place. The 3 pepper mark of heat is like 5 pepper mark anywhere else i usually eat. Whew\\n\\nName: Mumbai Spice; Review: Not a big fan of writting negative stuff. But unfriendly staff. Like the main waitress was kind of rude may be she had a long day. Food I would say was ok. I would suggest never try lamb or goat because the meat is never tender this is my second experience. I ordered a goat biryani. There were tiny tiny bones so it was really uncomfortable to eat, I ate just two spoons and gave up, well goat and lamb is with bones but tiny bones are really risky if you swallow you might get choked. Biryani was I would say atleast a week old ( easily figures out with the taste and size of the rice grain) was very spicy, the masala was not in proportion. Goan curry was amazing loved the taste. Nan was ok no complains. Kachori chat was also ok.  One more thing I was not sure of they already add tips which I guess was 15% and do they expect us to write more tips because below of the invoice there was suggestion for tips. Not sure. Overall I would give one more try and see if they can make some changes   \n",

- brown rice, extra, is perfect -  quite fair, even good value, so just order doubles of things and move the protein to one and save the second for leftovers later; maybe do not fear ordering spicy 2, and if so inclined spicy\\n\\nName: Spicy World; Review: The food is good, but the service is not good at all... I had to ask for two things again because they overlooked what I wrote on the menu that you're supposed to fill out. Also, the container on tables where skewers are thrown out need to be cleaned! The servers just remove the empty skewers and leave the dirty containers for next customers. I was appalled, looked so disgusting.  Also, the staff need to learn how to say thank you or sorry when they miss something. I was actually afraid to ask for water towards the end\\n\\nName: Mumbai Spice; Review: Not a big fan of writting negative stuff. But unfriendly staff. Like the main waitress was kind of rude may be she had a long day. Food I would say was ok. I would suggest never try lamb or goat because the meat is never tender this is my second experience. I ordered a goat biryani. There were tiny tiny bones so it was really uncomfortable to eat, I ate just two spoons and gave up, well goat and lamb is with bones but tiny bones are really risky if you swallow you might get choked. Biryani was I would say atleast a week old ( easily figures out with the taste and size of the rice grain) was very spicy, the masala was not in proportion. Goan curry was amazing loved the taste. Nan was ok no complains. Kachori chat was also ok.  One more thing I was not sure of they already add tips which I guess was 15% and do they expect us to write more tips because below of the invoice there was suggestion for tips. Not sure. Overall I would give one more try and see if they can make some changes\\n\\nName: China Gourmet Restaurant; Review: Totally not spicy. The taste is ok, but the Hunan cuisine has been improved. Jintang fat beef pickled pepper taste is too light, sour and spicy appetizers can not be done. The chopped peppers in the chopped pepper fish head looked much, but in fact there was nothing spicy. Look at Fuzhou cuisine like this.\\n\\nName: Chilli Thai Bistro; Review: REALLY good Thai food!! Love it. Wish i lived around here so i could frequent this place. The 3 pepper mark of heat is like 5 pepper mark anywhere else i usually eat. Whew   \n",

       "0    Name: The Met Back Bay; Review: Two stars because the food was good, but the service sucks. I went on Sunday after work, I was sitting on the patio.I had a order of calamari that was awesome and later I had one of the burger that was good. The server didn't know what beers are in the house, I asked for one Belgium beer and they didn't have it, then the server came back ten minutes later to say that they don't have that beer, then I asked about what kind of beer is the seasonal of Sam Adams, he said \"summer\", that's not a kind of beer. After the drink, I wanted one appetizer and the main course, so I asked my server about some recommendations. He just showed me the menu again. Afterwards, I asked him about the size of the calamari, he said that it is just an appetizer, and it would be ok  if I have it as an appetizer. When it came, it was too big just for one, specially if I am going to have a burger later. At the end he just dropped the check without asking if I'm going to have something else, and I wanted a dessert and another beer. So disappointed about this place\\n\\nName: The Met Back Bay; Review: Two stars because the food was good, but the service sucks.

Made reservations for Friday night (as you should for any restaurant in that area) and everything was exceptional! Big thanks to Roy, our server Sam, and all the other staff who were attentive and kind to our party. Between the 5 of us we tried the highly recommended blackened octopus, the oysters, the french onion macaroni and cheese, the spicy fried cauliflower, the Nashville hot chicken thighs, the chicken wings, the biscuits, and the beignets. Every single plate was delicious!! The cauliflower was crispy and paired with a great creamy sauce, the mac and cheese was baked well and oozing with flavor inside, the octopus was very flavorful and wasn't overcooked, and both the wings and thighs were fought over! And the biscuits... there aren't words to describe how perfectly crispy and sweet they were on top and how salty and fluffy they were on the inside and on top of it all they're MASSIVE and paired with a great cinnamon butter dip and another cheese dip that we took to go. The beignets were equally as tantalizing - super soft and sweet and on second thought we should've ordered a second plate of them to bring home...The drinks were all exceptional too, ask for whatever is popular - can't remember all the names but we ran through 3 or different 4 mixes (the whodi smash was the last one I had - its strong and made with Woodford bourbon 🙂) I can't say enough good things about this place - just go, eat, and enjoy\\n\\nName: Sawa Hibachi Steakhouse and Sushi; Review: Food Court quality at dine-in prices , we ordered 4 dinners and 4 appetizers to test the menu place was semi empty food came almost too quickly  a bad sign the appetizers were underwhelming amd the real disappointment was the dinners , swimming in Sugary syrup were soggy vegetables and cold microwave rice , decorations were swanky hookah bar theme in a japanese steak house , no wagu beef  choices no imagination and bad execution, I am done with mall eateries that disguise themselves as big city high quality nuveau cuisine when its only a panda express at best go if you ilke a low key private setting since you’re the only one there ar\\n\\nName: Les Zygomates Wine Bar & Bistro; Review: So apparently Zygomates is under new ownership with a new chef and I was lucky enough to be invited to taste their menu and besides for a few small misses the meal was a hit. The staff was phenomenal and did a great job explaining the dishes as they were dropped off to the table, which in my opinion doesn't happen enough in higher end restaurants. Les Zygomates is also in the middle of a renovation and from what was completed it looked pretty sharp.  Here is what I tasted:  Charcuterie - Great little board with a focus on duck. Duck pastrami and the pate were great  House made duck confit nuggets - I was just able to try one of these. Great concept, as someone who loves duck I think these were spot on. Crunchy on the outside and flavorful on the inside  Smoked Salmon - This was a highlight of the meal and I'm not usually a smoked salmon fan. It was served on top of a chip and I found it very flavorful  Poached Shrimp - This was also served on some type of chip, it was good but I thought it was just good shrimp on a chip  southeast Asian Mussels - Another highlight of the meal. I think the whole table was caught off guard at how good these tasted and the presentation. The curry and coconut flavors were perfect but not overpowering.  Gnocchi in a Garlic Cream Sauce w/ Escargot and Lamb Bacon - This was hands down my favorite dish. I wasn't sure if I would dig the lamb bacon but it helped perfect the complex flavor profile. The fresh gnocchi's were almost slightly crispy which I enjoyed.  Lobster Bisque - I've never had lobster bisque with a puff pastry on top but it was a welcome addition. There were a few chunks of lobster in there as well.  Bone in Veal - While I wouldn't normally order giant hunks of meat while at dinner if this is your style then this is a killer dish. The veal had a great crust that was just crispy enough and flavorful. It was cooked perfectly medium rare.  Creme Brulee - Not much else to say other than it was a perfect rendition of this classic dessert  Lemon Souffle - I never tried a lemon souffle before but I really enjoyed the tart and fruity flavors of this dish. Seems like a great palette cleanser to end a meal.  Baked Alaska - One of the best presented dishes of the night. They lit it on fire tableside. As far as taste goes I found it a little too boozey and thought the chocolate ice cream inside wasn't a good fi  \n",

I found the drink prices reasonable, because I don't mind paying for creative concoctions with a kick. But I bet others would find them overpriced. The actual bar is quite small so I'd imagine it takes a little while to get a drink when the place is crowded. But overall I would recommend this lounge-style location for its ambiance and fun liquors\\n\\nName: Better Sorts Social Club; Review: Best cocktails around!  The space is so luxe - ambient lighting, plush furniture, crystal glassware... a truly upscale experience.  They have seasonal cocktails (as well as year-round), an extensive wine & liquor list, and food/snacks.  It's the perfect place to relax with a cocktail and friends or a date.  They also have spirit-free cocktail options which came in handy for my pregnant friend.  I bring all my out-of-town guests here.  We had a hard time finding it the first time - the doors to enter are right on Tremont street.  Highly recommend\\n\\nName: Four Winds; Review: LOVE the bartenders and the new menu is amazing! It's my local spot and always will be :\\n\\nName: The Boston Shaker; Review: This smartly-designed Davis Square shop stocks just about everything you need to craft perfect drinks at home or on-the-job at a professional bar. Don't be fooled by the modest size of this boutique; inside lies an emporium-like inventory of bitters, glassware, and cocktail books.  Adam and his staff are incredibly knowledgeable and enthusiastic about what they do. Whether you're in search of a gift, in need of basics for cocktailing at home, or looking for the latest addition to your professional bar arsenal, they'll be sure to steer you in the right direction.  No booze? No problem - you won't need to go far. Dave's Fresh Pasta, just steps away, carries an impressive selection of vermouth and aperitif liqueurs. Meanwhile, Downtown Wine & Spirits, also nearby, boasts a great selection of full-strength spirits\\n\\nName: Merrill & Co.; Review: The space is updated from the 28 Degrees decor, with the new layout both making it more open while also increasing the number of distinct, comfortable spaces within the restaurant. There's a small but solid craft beer selection, really great comfort food in shareable plates, and excellent cocktails. This is a laid back spot off the beaten path, but it's walkable from Boylston and Back Bay bars - and worth the trek if you're looking for something friendly, comfortable and still classy enough for solid cocktails  \n",

They knew of Papa's and highly recommended it.  Boy, were they right!  The pizza got there quick, it was HOT, and it was incredible!  We ordered two extra larges (Margherita and Meat Lover) and everyone loved them!  The crusts and sauce were wonderful. (It took me back to my younger days when we would go out Sunday after church to our favorite Italian restaurant in Cleveland).  So I decided before we came home, I would have to take the family there to eat.  We arrived and though it was busy, we were seated immediately by a very courteous, friendly host.  Our server got to us quickly and got our drinks while making some suggestions for my wife and I as well as the kids.  Just like the take-out pizza, in in-house food was perfect as well!  Chicken Alfredo, Strawberry Walnut Salad, Meatball Sub, and my one kid actually ordered a Steak Teriyaki Bowl (at an italian restaurant????) and I was shocked at how good it was!  Even the Assistant Manager Konstantine came by to see how everything was.  He was a very nice young man.  Service was spot on without being overbearing.  Wish I could bring this place down to FL with me as well as give it more stars than just five\\n\\nName: Mario's Restaurant; Review: Mario's looks like the quintessential local Italian restaurant-- exposed brick walls, checkered table cloths, and a menu full of Italian comfort food.  After eating here twice, I find that it is really a disappointment. The food is suprisingly pricy considering the neighborhood and the interior of the restaurant. $17 for a pasta dish, anything with meat runs around $20, and seafood can top out next to $30. I don't mind paying that kind of money for good Italian food having grown up in Providence, but the food wasn't that much to write home about.  The pasta was overcooked, the razor-thin pounded veal lacked flavor and was soggy. The lobster in the pasta special was a bit rubbery. I know others have had a great experience at this restaurant, but for a local, casual Italian restaurant, the food isn't nearly good enough to justify prices that belong more in the North End than Eastie\\n\\nName: Rino's Place; Review: WoW, WoW, WoW! Every dish I got tonight was absolutely fabulous and when they came, they FLOOD! The wait was over two hours long on a Friday night by 8pm, so come early or come on a weekday!  Here's the gist: Get here, sign in, leave your number, go find a bar nearby, drink, wait, receive a call, and EAT!  The restaurant is small to keep the quality here as high as possible to the owner's desire. You will absolutely be stuffed coming out of this restaurant, so get one less dish than you think you want to order.  My order and take on it: CALAMARI - calamari battered & fried and finished in a spicy pepper ring sauce $12 (OMG, the best calamari I have ever had because the taste is sooo complete! There's is no marinara or any sort of sauce needed for this dish. I don't know what it is, but the spicy pepper ring brings this dish a whole level up. Don't be scared, it's not spicy at all!)  VITELLO MARSALA - scallopini of veal sauteed with mushrooms and ham. Finished in a marsala wine sauce $12 (Veal is beaten down to a pulp with a layer of ham on top and another layer of cheese on top of that. It's so tender! Marsala sauce is perfect with this...if you don't want to carbo load, get any of the Marsala dishes depending what kind of meat you're craving for...yum!  GNOCCHI - homemade potato dumplings sauteed in a fresh plum tomato sauce and topped with fresh mozzarella and baked $15 (OMG, I could make this dish into four meals...it's so filling, but so worth it! The dish is perfectly cheesy and bouncy!)  LOBSTER RAVIOLI - Their star dish of Rino's and featured on FOOD network. It's absolutely the best lobster ravioli I have ever had and it's something you must get and share among your party. DO IT!  Frutti Di Mare - Seafood overload beyond belief. They do not skimp on their portion on this dish and it's so fresh! You get to pick whatever type of pasta you desire to complement this dish and I went with the fusilli pasta, yum!  Tiramisu - Perfect end to the meal and it's so creamy and delicious! You might as well pair it off with a cup of cappuccino or coffee :)  Overall, my dinner was a phenomenal experience at Rino's. I'm glad I got to try this restaurant and I can't wait to come back to Rino's sometime soon again.  PS. Parking is a pain here because it's packed in the residential area of Boston East, so carpool or take the T. The walk from the T is a bit far to Rino's, but it's doable!  Close on Sunday, hours below: Monday: 4pm - 9pm / Tuesday - Thursday: 11am - 9pm / Friday: 11am - 10pm / Saturday: 3pm - 10p\\n\\nName: Pini's Pizzeria; Review: This place really does have the best pizza in town and probably surrounding towns, although I can't confirm. Their delivery is really fast too. I forget about this place especially since I'm not driving by it every day but when I remember it exists and I want pizza this is definitely my go-to. The only \"issue\" is that outside of pizza their menu is pretty limited. My wife has a dairy allergy and doesn't like red sauce so she doesn't eat pizza much and if she does she gets one without cheese and sauce (Bianca) which she really likes but that's really the only thing she would like on the menu. Because of that, if we order takeout we need to order from a place that has a larger selection of subs/wraps/salads\\n\\nName: Babbo Pizzeria e Enoteca; Review: Wow we had the salads...pizzas and pastas. Now we're a party of 18, difficulty to please straight up Italians. Salad...arugula and tomato (tomatoes were incredible), summer Caesar = awesome. Pizzas: margarita was top notch, calabrese wowwww even got a vegan to try and was definitely not upset she ate the sausage. Zucchini pizza was fantastic also.  Nowwww the pastas!!! Again we are Italians we make our own pasta this was unreal.  Tagliatelle Bolognese some said was their favorite, others said the rock shrimp pasta with corn was theirs . Then we got the buccatini with guancele...game changer. Deserts? Yes please unreal like we made our own...  Again we don't give out this rating for Italian food this easily, in fact we never eat Italian out because we're disappointed that we could make it better at home. Nope not this time....we will be back and you are insane if you don't consider going here as a top choice in Boston  \n",

(about $4-$6 per roll of 6 pieces) I ordered four rolls, and was disappointed; They did not taste good. I feel bad saying it, but even cheap store bought sushi tastes better  \n",

This place is accessible via an alley and the first thing you noticed the beautiful door. You walk downstairs to a heavily-decorated Mexican restaurant with all the decor from Mexico. It has a very traditional Mexican restaurant feel.  FOOD: Seemed to be a little bit more authentic than your average Mexican food restaurant. We realized that since we arrived before 6 and would leave by 7 that we could order the early bird special which has 3 courses for $24. I was hungry so I went for it.  Marinated Chicken Wings with Mole Sauce - These chicken wings were on the fattier side but the sauce was rich and delicious. This also came with fried plantains on top which was a nice sweet element. I LOVE fried plantains.  Pulled Roasted Pork (aka Cochinita Pibil) - SO delicious. Perfect balance of a little spicy with very savory. The meat was so tender. I wish I could have eaten this all night.  Mexican-Style Crepes - not sure what makes this Mexican besides the caramel on top but this is also filled with sliced bananas. Came with a side of vanilla ice cream. Delicious and wish I had more.  Portions were on the smaller side compared to other Mexican restaurants, though that may have been because it was part of the early bird special. I would definitely come back for the early bird special.  Tip: If you order before 6 and leave before 7, get the early bird special. $24 for 3 courses. What a deal! Keep that in mind if you are hungry one afternoon in Back Bay\\n\\nName: Herrera's Mexican Grill; Review: Visiting Boston, MA for the first time. Asked locals what to check out- they recommended this. So glad they did! The food is fresh and the line was out the door. I ordered tacos. Delicious. My dad ordered an enchilada- I tasted it- the best enchilada I've ever had. Also- they have plenty of salsas to choose from\\n\\nName: La Hacienda; Review: My family and I are from Texas where Mexican restaurants are a staple. We recently moved to the Boston area and have been searching for good Mexican, or Latin food type of restaurant. I found this place on Google maps and saw that it had nearly 1200 reviews and a rating of 4.5 stars. So I took my family to this place on a Saturday night with high hopes. We first walked in and stood at the hostess podium waiting for a few minutes for someone to greet then sit us. After a couple of minutes a staff member walked up, gave a half smile to us and walked away without saying anything. Finally a middle aged gentleman came and sat us. A server finally came by out table to ask what we wanted to drink and dropped off the chips and salsa. The server wasnt very friendly, she didnt offer to tell us anything about the restaurant or the menu. We ordered a couple of margaritas from their drink menu. While waiting for the drinks I tried the chips and salsa. My god I've never seen salsa with so many chunks of white onion. The Salsa literally was chunks of white onion and tomato sauce. The chips were stale. Got out margaritas. Not impressed. They tasted like like juice, soap water, and cheap tequila. The children's menu only offers, hot dogs, cheese burger and chicken fingers or wings... what kind of mexican restaurant doesnt offer any type of mexican dish on their Children's menu? I had to pay $9.00 for a cheese quesadilla off the regular menu for my daughter. It was so disgusting that she wouldn't even eat it.. and this girl loves cheese. Our server never came back by to check on us, or ask us if we would like another drink.  Although she came by once after my wife's food was dropped off to ask us how our meals were. Only problem is that my daughter and I were still waiting to receive our food. She was completely oblivious to the fact that there were no plates of food in front of us. I guess that worked better because if she would have asked us when we actually had our food, then I would have told her it was no better than \"ok\". We had to litterally ask another server to help us. If you are looking for a good experience or even just decent food... try else where. I miss Papasitos and Uncle Julios back in Texas\\n\\nName: Mexicali Sushi Bar; Review: Mexican style sushi, I get the chance to try the “Chiles Güeros” (Caribbean peppers stuffed with cream cheese and shrimp wrapped in bacon)... they were for lack of a better word were just perfect! Then I had the seafood tower and the aguachile shrimp.. both excellent! But my favorite of the night was the Mexicali sushi roll! All around everything was super good plus the hibiscus water and the cucumber water were legit like if you had ordered one from the “michoacana” (Mexican juice stop). Definitely coming back very very soon\\n\\nName: Tavitas Mexican; Review: Do not call this Tex-Mex or Mexican! The cheese for the tortilla chips (cardboard and tasteless) came as a greasy hard block of something that resembled something of a mozzarella/white American cheese blend you might find on a bad pizza. Not  anywhere close to a Mexican ques . Should not be served anywhere. The chimichanga was greasy ground beef with questionable vegetables and strange seasonings. The dough was tough, tasteless and soggy in the middle. After spending 15 years in Houston and trying all kinds of tex-mex, this was by far the very worst. SOOOO disappointing! Has the chef and cooking staff ever tried good tex-mex? This really isnt a matter of preference in prep or seasoning, it just us really not tex-mex at all! On a crazy side note...why is there rap music being played in a Mexican restaurant? Seriously?? Ugh  \n",

The ambiance and restaurant itself was beautiful. We went on a Sunday night on the evening of my birthday. The cocktail list was impressive and the drinks were awesome! The food..not so much. Maybe it was a mistake ordering seafood at a steakhouse but my halibut came out dry as a bone. They offer pan seared, grilled or baked. I figured panseared would be the best option for keeping the fish moist and flavorful. Boy was I wrong! It appeared like they baked it from the looks of it. My husband ordered 8oz filet medium rare. It came out medium well. The sides were good and our app of tuna tartare was good too. We didn't  complain since it was my birthday but thinking back, for the money he spent on the meal, I wouldn't dare eat there again. Maybe just come back for the drinks\\n\\nName: Smith & Wollensky; Review: PROS: - EXCELLENT customer service! Made reservations for our 2nd anniversary dinner months ago. Seated quickly (Monday night, so could be because it was slow), and manager was willing to relocate us to one of the more beautiful dining rooms upon request (see CONS/Pro-tip below for more info). A timeless room, filled with history. Greeted with 2 glasses of complimentary champagne to congratulate us for our anniversary, which was a very thoughtful touch. Our waitress, Rudy, was knowledgeable about the castle and entertained us with facts about the Library Room (see pro-tip below) while we enjoyed our meal. - Great, extensive wine and drink list. - Food was SUPERB--I ordered the gorgonzola encrusted steak (applewood smoked bacon, scallions) and my husband ordered 2 bacon-wrapped steak medallions. We shared a lemon-asparagus appetizer. The steaks were FANTASTICALLY juicy, full of flavor, and the high-quality steak knives cut through with minimal effort. The asparagus was cooked to perfection. We finished with their 10-layer chocolate cake, which we were not able to finish by any means (who doesn't love dessert leftovers?), along with coffee. - The manager has a great dry sense of humor :)  CONS (more of a pro-tip): - We were originally seated in the \"main dining room,\" which was really just an extension of the bar/lounge. The other two 1st floor dining rooms (beautiful, historic) were closed for the night, likely because it was a slow Monday evening. Rock music was playing. Better to go on a weekend evening when the other dining rooms are open. Ask to reserve a table in \"The Library Room,\" where you can see beautiful, timeless pieces of America's history all around you as you eat--original flags from before we had 50 states, original hand-painted map of Boston, engraved crown molding with Generals from U.S. battles dating back to 1776!  Pro-tip TD;LR: Worth going regardless of day/time if you want to just enjoy a casual night of steaks, but only go on weekends when they are busy if you want to enjoy a fancier, or more history-filled dinner\\n\\nName: Piccolo Nido; Review: After having a  few pleasant dinners at Piccolo Nido, we decided to celebrate our daughter's engagement there. It was one of the worst and most embarrassing dinners we have ever had at a restaurant. We had reservations and arrived on time, we were one of the first parties there. As the restaurant filled with patrons the service, at our table of 10, the wait staff became less and less attentive. EVERYONE at the restaurant was served their dinner before us. We waited 2 hours before our dinner was served. When I asked why everyone else was already served, the owner, Pino, came to the table and in a very rude way (so that everyone could hear) said that they don't usually accomodate parties of 10, (then why did they take a reservation for a party of 10?) and that there were people with children who had come in after us, (so were we to wait because people come in with kids, not my problem!) so naturally they would be served first. We will NEVER return to Piccolo Nido again. Worst dining experience ever! Food was average by the way. Much better restaurants in the North End\\n\\nName: Gaslight; Review: We come here for our anniversary, and the service we receive is enough to keep us coming back every year.  I just add a little note notifying them of the occasion, and the entire staff seemed to know (in a positive way).  What blew my mind was when we arrived, without a word to the bartender, they directed us to the bar to wait for our table.  The bartender already knew who we were and handed us two glasses of champagne and wished us a happy anniversary with a smile.  This really impressed me, it was so seamless.  After a short while they brought us to the table.  The waiters we have had are always some of the best I have had in Boston, although we admittedly do not dine out like this very often.  The food is always amazing.  French onion soup split for 2 is the way to go every time.  In recent times we have had the steak, the duck, and the mussles.  All were fantastic.  Sitting outside on a nice evening is wonderful as well, as long as it is decently warm.  (they do have heaters!)  This is a great spot for a special occasion!!  \n",

I eat it at least twice a week. Have tried almost all Boston pizza places and this hidden gem is one of the two best pizza spots in Boston. The pizza is thin and crispy and the quality of toppings is superb. The buffalo chicken pizza is a 10/10. The person working was extremely nice. Highest recommendation, this place needs to get on the map\\n\\nName: Flames Restaurant II; Review: Flames is very good. Almost a homely and comfortable feel. Food is varied, generous, ..and absolutely delicious!! Great oxtail, goat meat, jerk, fish steaks. Oh yes, the beef patty, a must try. The cod fritter is great too. Get the rice with beans, and sure, for sure, the cabbage and carrots! And the jerk wings?!!! God, where do I stop?!!  When you walk through the door u see that they were Zagat rated. When the food is in your mouth , you will know that they deserve.  Good food in that neighborhood is mostly subs and pizzas. In the midst of that, they are heaven.  Only, they are a little fussy about 'dine in'. You have to make up your mind, are you \"taking out\" or dining in? They look more like a deli, but don't like you buying a box and sit down to eat from it, if you felt like! So if you want to dine in, please sit down and wait to be table service :). By the way, they stop dine in at least 30min before the restaurant closing, while you can continue to buy carry out\\n\\nName: Barracuda on the Fly; Review: Friendly staff at clean location with ~20ppl worth of seating. Friendly for locals and youth. If you work near the location you can get 10% off. If you have college you can get 10% off. You can order online for pick up. Not for a long stay as it seems that they do not have a bathroom for customer. Good spot for quick lunch\\n\\nName: Ocean Prime; Review: If you are looking for fine dining in downtown Boston, this is definitely the place, chain or no chain. This is going to give Grill 23, Capital Grille and Ruth Chris Steak House a run for their money, which the latter two are chains as well. First off, the location absolutely hits the mark and is in the center of the action. This sits in a central spot directly at the beginning of the seaport district. The valet parking is a bit tight seeing this is a busy street, however they are quick on their feet and even send you an automated text when the car is being delivered.  The interior of this place is quite large and you would never know it from the street. The bar area is beautiful and the whole place is elegantly decorated and looks really cool and trendy. The bar serves up some creative cocktails, even a really cool berry concoction with dry ice that tasted excellent. We got their a bit early and our Saturday reservation was not until 8:30pm so we sat in the bar. The place was very crowded and the hostess station was a bit disorganized. We did not get seated until around 8:45pm since they were waiting on tables to clear but with 3 hostesses, thats how busy this place was on Saturday night.  We were seated in a back room area which was nicely secluded and the main dining room is split up into multiple rooms. The staff here is so good, they attend to you right away and are there throughout every step of the meal which was nice. The menu is large with not only more cocktails, appetizers, sushi, seafood and of course steak done many different ways. We opted for appetizers of goat cheese ravioli, deviled eggs with caviar and steak tartar which all were incredible. The goat cheese ravioli melted in your mouth. For entrees, we ordered filets, scallops and a surf and turf with sides of smoked gouda tater tots (just delicious) and some sautéed brussel sprouts. Every bite was tender, cooked to perfection and tasted beautiful. I have eaten at Capital Grille many times as well as Abe and Louies and this steak blew them out of the water.  For dessert we were about to order when an older gentleman from another table came over and told us we were being too loud which was probably one of the rudest things that could happen during a night out, of which we let him know before he left. Our waiter overheard the exchange and offered up free dessert of a 10 layer carrot cake (yes 10), chocolate covered peanut butter cake and a brownie batter ice cream which again all hit the spot, delicious. This meal was very good and I would highly recommend this place. Prices are what you would expect for fine dining and it was worth every penny\\n\\nName: Real Deal, LLC; Review: Covid helpful info: parallel street parking, no meters. Most times of the day you can find a spot near this location. Once you walk into the joint you will go to the cashier to get your food. They have 2-3 tables inside but not sure if you can dine in there. No tables to dine out, it is mostly a location people do take out or delivery from.  This location is a local favorite for me. I used to live near the Cleveland Circle location, hang out with friends near the JP one, and now I live by the West Roxbury location and I love them all equally. Their food is consistent and they are always quick. My favorite app that I get almost every time is their onion rings because they are really yummy but I am a big fan of sauces and their kickin bayou sauce is delicious! The sauce is like a sriracha, Mayo, and other yummy things (real deal sorry if I’m wrong with those ingredients!) Meals I typically get are the Joe Spa (chicken Caesar wrap), Reuben, grown up grilled cheese, any burger, and any pizza. Definitely would recommend going to any of their locations  \n",

Very local, multicultural feel. The menu was exactly what you would expect from a local dinner, and the food was excellent. I went simple and got a cheeseburger and fries, but the burger was delicious, and the fries weren't greasy. The cost for my entire meal and tip was $12. I'd absolutely recommend this place for a comfortable, quick, familiar bite to eat\\n\\nName: FiRE+iCE; Review: Be prepared for the amazing Fire and Ice in Back Bay which is very close to shopping stores. My favorite food is the Alfredo spaghetti with shrimp. I think you might like it as much as I do. You should try it and you might like it to because you don't have to go that far from the shopping stores. I love the music they play because it's calm and fun music that a lot of people know.  The set up is so good. There are two floors. On the first floor there's a bar for adults. On the second floor there's all the food. If you want to go to a buffet you can go to Fire+Ice because you get the food exactly like you are in a buffet. The food is all set up. You get the food you want. The only difference about is that the food is frozen. There is a table in the middle where you can watch them cook it. It only takes a few minutes or seconds for them to cook it for you. If you want you can bring 15 people with you because there are big tables. There are a lot of tables on the second floor. The chefs don't have any kitchens they have a cooking table in the middle of the second floor. You can even watch your food be cooked and other people's food be cooked as well. On the second floor there are decorations on the ceiling made out of wood. They look like anything you would put in a burger, like cheese, buns, ketchup, salad, tomatoes, and anything you could expect to put in a burger. My favorite is the cheese because they made it like the cheese with the holes in it. They are perfectly cut out. The view is pretty cool that you can see the park across the street. You can see the entrance to the park and the playground. The view at night is really cool because the lights are really bright and you can see the park much better.  The food is so good. Like I said the Alfredo spaghetti with shrimp in it is my favorite. The reason why I like the Alfredo spaghetti is because the sweetness of the Alfredo is so good. With normal sauce it makes the spaghetti taste dry which is my opinion. To me sometimes, with tomato sauce, it tastes kind of dry. But, with alfredo sauce, since it tastes so sweet, it's like it is blowing my mouth up. They also have an ice cream bar, chinese food, veggies, salsa bar, rice, seafood and fruit. The ice cream bar has so many kinds of toppings. The toppings are oreos, m and ms, chocolate chips, hot fuge, and resies pesies. When I walk in the restaurant I smell all the food that is being cooked at once. When you eat the food it's not to cold, hot, or burnt. It is perfectly made. The Chinese food they have is the rice, chicken and veggie rice. A way to know you like the food is if you get very messy. Usually when people like the food, the get more and more plates. When I got more plates, I get very full and my face is covered with Alfredo sauce and spaghetti.  If you live in Boston then you will be able to go to Fire+and Ice very easily. It's very close to the train station. It's in Back Bay near the orange line. It's also very close to Chinatown since Back Bay is the stop almost in the middle between Oak Grove and Forest Hills. It is about two stops away from the middle. When you exit Fire and Ice, around the corner there is Marshall's. There is also a little walk-in area next to Marshall's where there are shopping stores. There is also the Prudential Mall that is very close to Fire and Ice and there are lots of shopping stores there and there are lots of other restaurants and places there too.  Those are all three reasons why I think Fire+Ice is my favorite restaurant ever. Whenever you go to Fire+Ice I hope you like it so much. I still have a feeling that you will like the food no matter what.  - Written by Laila, a third grader in Ms. Taryn's clas\\n\\nName: Pronti Sandwich Co.; Review: My family found new favorite eats last night!

My name is Audrey and I'm going to tell you about Wonder Spice Cafe!  Wonder Spice Cafe is the best restaurant ever! I love Wonder spice because the food is delicious, the service is great, and the location is perfect!! When you walk into Wonder Spice, you will think that you have walked into a dream. You will smell the good food cooking on the stove, and you see customers sitting at the tables, waiting patiently for their food. Everything you get is always delicious.  Wonder Spice Cafe's food is one of the best things you will ever try!! The spring rolls are really good, nice and crispy. The shumais are warm and soft. They're like swallowing a big warm hug. The golden triangles are crispy and crunchy, full of flavor. Their pad thai is the dream. It's mixed up with the most delicious shrimp and chicken I have ever tasted. Wonder Spice also has the best drinks. It has water, milk, juice, and more!  You have got to try out Wonder Spice's food!!!!!  Wonder Spice Cafe's location is just as good as their food. They have a parking lot near the restaurant, and sometimes you can get a really good parking spot in front of the restaurant. Wonder Spice Cafe is located in JP (Jamaica Plain), near JP Licks. If you do not have a car, you can take a taxi, uber, or lyft. Wonder Spice Cafe is also near Dunkin Donuts, Fresh Hair, Curtis Hall, Boing, and a playground, baseball field, CVS Pharmacy, and Noodle Barn.  Wonder Spice Cafe's service is really good, too.

Heed the spice warnings on the menu.  Amateras ramen seems to be a popular spot for a quick bowl of ramen on those plentiful chilly Boston days. We went there around 5:45pm on a Thursday night and were seated immediately. The boiled gyoza appetizer was great - the wrappers were some of the softest ones I'd ever tasted. My 5X spicy miso ramen was flavorful. I didn't know how Amateras' spice scale compared relative to other places so I started there, but next time I will definitely be going 10x. My husband's level 2 spicy green monster was definitely the spicier of the two. The thai chiles in the clear broth definitely packed a punch.  The staff is polite, friendly, and attentive. Our waters were kept filled, table was set and cleared promptly, and our server processed our payment quickly\\n\\nName: China Gourmet Restaurant; Review: Totally not spicy.

The chopped peppers in the chopped pepper fish head looked much, but in fact there was nothing spicy.

They now have a no spice option if you want to taste their delicious chicken without the spicy jam.  The service was great and our food was ready for pickup the exact time we got to the restaurant. Our server was kind and we didn't wait at all.  I got two box meals with two Thai teas. The box meals come with two pieces of fried chicken, sticky rice, shrimp chips, green papaya salad. Both of the boxes were exactly the same so don't worry about consistency!  Fried Chicken: The chicken had such crazy crispy skin! After driving home for 30 minutes it was still crispy and the meat inside was juicy. The sauce on top is REALLY flavorful and I thought it went well with the other items in the box. I thought it had a nice spice which wasn't too much but left a nice heat on your tongue. If you don't like spice thought it will be wAYYYY too spicy for you so stick to the no spice option.  Sticky Rice: This tasted like normal sticky rice and was great with the chicken or the salad!  Papaya Salad: This salad had so many flavors, it was really refreshing to eat along with the chicken! Though it was waaaay too spicy for me it was perfect for my boyfriend. I thought the papaya salad was spicier than the chicken lol.  Shrimp chips: These are the normal shrimp chips you eat. I think they were really nice to eat between the salad and the chicken and I even used it like a chip to hold the salad and chicken!  [invited\\n\\nName: Mumbai Spice; Review: I am in a spree of finding the best Biriyani in Boston. And Mumbai spice is definitely up, there, in the top three! I ordered Lamb Biriyani with baby corn Manchurian and I should say my taste buds had an amazing treat!  About the biriyani:  1. The spice mix was perfect. It wasn't bland, it wasn't too spicy. It was just perfect. Some places add too much spice randomly (when you ask them to make it spicy), which ruins the flavor and your stomach. Mumbai spice had the right amount of spice. 2. The lamb was cooked perfectly. A lot of places tend to over cook lamb, but Mumbai spice got it right. 3. The portion was generous 4. The price was reasonable.  The baby corn Manchurian was awesome too. It had a nice crispness to it. Its refreshing to see different items instead of the regular paneer/ chicken Manchurians. Kudos and would definitely recommend this place\\n\\nName: Chicked's Chicken & Grill; Review: Very bad tasting food. I asked for nothing spicy and the woman said it wasn't spicy and that the chicken sandwich comes with mayo,lettuce and tomato. I asked for no tomato. I waited a  30 mins to get a sandwich with hot sauce on i  \n",

I recommend takeout as the restaurant is not ideal for eating inside. We enjoyed the rainbow roll, spicy tuna, spicy crab, calamari and eel-avocado roll. 5 stars\\n\\nName: India Quality Restaurant; Review: If this is the quality of food in India, then I do not want to go. It blows my mind that it has such great reviews.  For starters, the place looks dirty and isn't welcoming. The waiters were many but none of them took care of us.  Now on to the disappointing food. We ordered many things because we were excited the place had such praising reviews. I even asked how long they have been in business, 31 years and counting.  We got samosas as starters, they were nothing but a frozen flash fried catastrophe. The garlic naan bread was drenched in oil, had too much garlic and wasn't cooked throughout. This was also for the second naan, pashwari which had too much honey in it.  The diet cokes we ordered came in a dirty glass, as a matter of fact all the glasses we got were dirty.  I had lamb madras, it was a watery flavorless substance that I did not recognize as being that dish. The taste was only of spiciness and the lamb felt more like a rubbery beef. We also got chicken korma and it was distasteful as well. The rice we got was too flavorful with spices they used and it took away from other flavors.  The bill wasn't cheap and definitely not worth the money. I do not recommend this place to anyone. Please don't waste your time and money\\n\\nName: Suishaya; Review: Friends of mine took me once to this place, with Korean and Japanese styles dishes, inside Chinatown hood.  If you look for a fork, knife or spoon, don't look for them, it's supposed to use your provided chopsticks and in case you order something that it's mandary in order to help eating it, they will be provided.  This was my first Korean restaurant in the US, so I declined their Sushi section in the menu and I headed to the Korean dishes.  First of all, you'll get some apetizers as red beans, bean spouts, carrot with chilli.  First time I tried Okdol Bibimbap, it came in a really hot pan, with all the ingredients ready to be cooked in it and a small recipient with spicy sauce. You have to be fast and start mixing it to don't get your food burnt. I ordered it with spicy pork, so it was spicy and very hot, it took me more than half hour to finish it, the amount of food also was big tho. My experience was food, the food, service and the local were good.  The second time I had Jam Bang with Korean noodle, also a big bowl came to the table, with the usual thick Korean noddles, mussels, shrimps and a selection of vegetables. As it was raining it was the perfect choice, it was both hot and spicy. The noodles and the soup were tasty and flavourful, I usually don't eat soup but this one it was really worth it.  As I came with some friends both times I tried Bulgogi Beef, that was pretty good.  The only bad things is they don't have beer nor home made tea, so don't expect anything good for drink.  The second time the fire alarm was triggered as some dishes are really hot and smoke comes out of them, but it's a mere anecdote\\n\\nName: China Gourmet Restaurant; Review: Totally not spicy. The taste is ok, but the Hunan cuisine has been improved. Jintang fat beef pickled pepper taste is too light, sour and spicy appetizers can not be done. The chopped peppers in the chopped pepper fish head looked much, but in fact there was nothing spicy. Look at Fuzhou cuisine like this.  \n",

I like it as a fatoush add-on, with a generous schmear of the most amazing garlic sauce, making a simultaneously healthy and decadent meal. The chicken kabobs (both spiced ground meat and marinated chunk versions) are also great. For vegetarian options, the falafel (freshly fried-to-order, not microwaved) and pumpkin kibbeh are fantastic. Honestly, pretty much everything on the menu is really good; if I weren't so addicted to the shawarma fatoush, I'd order other items more often. For those with a sweet tooth, they bake fresh trays daily of baklava and kanafeh. Haven't tried the baklava, but the kanafeh (sort of a Lebanese cheesecake) is a delightful treat.  Wonderful, hard-working Lebanese family runs this establishment. Can taste the home-cooked love that gets put into every dish. Big props to them for continuing to grind through this pandemic. Miss being able to enjoy meals in their dining room, but even in takeout the quality of the food remains as sky-high as before</td>\n",

Owner Serge gave an earnest smile and said, \"I hope you really enjoy it,\" as I received my chicken shawarma roll-up. And, did I ever enjoy it! The chicken here is amazing—perfectly juicy with just the right level of char and flavor. On a journey to the streets of Beirut, my mouth was in a kaleidoscope of flavors, from the incredible garlic sauce, to the crunchy fries, to the assorted other fillings.  I have since experienced the same passion poured into every dish. I can recommend the shawarma, soujouk, kafta, samke harra, and of course, the Falafel. The hummus has just the right blend of seasonings, flavorful yet not overwhelming. Try a platter with tabbouli or fattouch. They're so fresh with a satisfying crunch and seasonings that tantalize.  With food so good, and such a lovely experience with the kind owner, I wish I could afford to give Serge my money every day for lunch. I would not tire of the food</td>\n",

I haven't experienced a better eggplant treatment anywhere. On a frigid arctic day the soups are steaming hot and stews rich and satisfying.

       "8478  Best chicken shawarma I've ever had, hands-down. I like it as a fatoush add-on, with a generous schmear of the most amazing garlic sauce, making a simultaneously healthy and decadent meal. The chicken kabobs (both spiced ground meat and marinated chunk versions) are also great. For vegetarian options, the falafel (freshly fried-to-order, not microwaved) and pumpkin kibbeh are fantastic. Honestly, pretty much everything on the menu is really good; if I weren't so addicted to the shawarma fatoush, I'd order other items more often. For those with a sweet tooth, they bake fresh trays daily of baklava and kanafeh. Haven't tried the baklava, but the kanafeh (sort of a Lebanese cheesecake) is a delightful treat.  Wonderful, hard-working Lebanese family runs this establishment. Can taste the home-cooked love that gets put into every dish. Big props to them for continuing to grind through this pandemic. Miss being able to enjoy meals in their dining room, but even in takeout the quality of the food remains as sky-high as before  \n",
       "6811                                              It was a somber Thursday in July when I first visited Shawarma Falafel. Owner Serge gave an earnest smile and said, \"I hope you really enjoy it,\" as I received my chicken shawarma roll-up. And, did I ever enjoy it! The chicken here is amazing—perfectly juicy with just the right level of char and flavor. On a journey to the streets of Beirut, my mouth was in a kaleidoscope of flavors, from the incredible garlic sauce, to the crunchy fries, to the assorted other fillings.  I have since experienced the same passion poured into every dish. I can recommend the shawarma, soujouk, kafta, samke harra, and of course, the Falafel. The hummus has just the right blend of seasonings, flavorful yet not overwhelming. Try a platter with tabbouli or fattouch. They're so fresh with a satisfying crunch and seasonings that tantalize.  With food so good, and such a lovely experience with the kind owner, I wish I could afford to give Serge my money every day for lunch. I would not tire of the food  \n",

Variety abounds, from intensely flavored cold vegetarian salads to the meaty kebabs and specials.  If you are lucky enough to hit an eggplant or stuffed pepper or lamb special, go for it without hesitation.  The eggplant dishes here are buttery, unctuous, rich with flavor and texture. I haven't experienced a better eggplant treatment anywhere. On a frigid arctic day the soups are steaming hot and stews rich and satisfying.  On a Spring or Summer day, get a Kofte or Donner Kebab sandwich wrapped in pita and filled with broiling hot meats and cool Turkish salad with the pita barely holding it all together. There is also this great walk-around pita \"sandwich\" which is great as well  "

I will return again, God willing  "
