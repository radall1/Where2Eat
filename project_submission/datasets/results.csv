I want good appetizers,"Name: Darryl's Corner Bar & Kitchen; Review: Darryl’s in two words: “Never again.”  Please don’t make the same mistake we made; take your business elsewhere.  We waited nearly an hour for four appetizers. After I asked the “server” (I use the word loosely) to cancel the appetizers (because I assumed the entrees would be arriving in any minute), three of the appetizers finally appeared.  The fourth appetizer—a spinach salad—never did show up. Somehow, the kitchen was able to prepare one spinach salad for our table, but the second was evidently too high a bar to clear.  When the appetizers arrived, the manager assured me that the entrees were right behind them. He also looked me in the eye and (as it turned out) lied to me, saying that one entree (a grilled chicken sandwich) in particular was holding things up, but those entrees would be out shortly.  Three of the four entrees arrived after another wait, but that grilled chicken sandwich also turned out to be too much of a challenge for this establishment and it simply never arrived.  The kicker was this policy statement from their website: “To ensure that we can honor your reservations in a timely manner, we have a 2 hour maximum seating time during the prime times.” Deeply ironic, when, in the two hours we wasted at this establishment, this is a restaurant that couldn’t actually serve four appetizers and four entrees to four patrons.  At Darryl’s, to paraphrase P.T. Barnum, you can feed some of the people some of the time.  I have never written a review like this before, but, in two decades of restaurant-going as an adult, I’ve never seen “service” like this.  Two words—offered by either the “server” or the manager at any point—would have kept me from writing this review.  Darryl’s, say it with me, for future reference: “I’m sorry.”  Goodness knows you should be
Name: Sorellina; Review: Sorellina is good, but not worth a 5 star rating.  We dined with them this past Saturday.  The atmosphere is sophisticated and classy.  While we saw a few t-shirts and a ball cap at one table, the dress is upscale casual.  A sport coat for guys and a dress for the ladies is spot on.  Their service was very good and our location by a window added to the evening.  We started off with several appetizers including the Polpo (octopus), Cavatelli (rabbit and pasta), and Maccheroncelli (meatball, sauce and parmigiana).  All were prepared excellent and challenged the palate with sophisticated tastes.  But that's where the good food ended and the main courses were average.  Two of us got the  Milanese which was presented well, but dry and with little flavor.  The other dishes, Veal saltimbocca, and the Filet Mignon were again bland.  I don't know why the appetizers could be so good and the mains fair at best.   For the prices paid one would expect much better than average.  The 4 stars is a reprieve do to the excellent appetizers, but if it wasn't for those it would have been a 3
Name: Sky Restaurant; Review: We went to Sky this past weekend, and the experience was mixed.  I'll start with the bad.  The host at the front of the restaurant doesn't seem very friendly - no smiling at all and seemed a bit underdressed.  After sitting down and ordering a bottle of wine, the waitress poured us tastes of the wine and then left.  This seemed a bit odd, since every other restaurant usually pours the first glass. We sat for about 20 min before receiving bread and had to request it from one of the bussers.  We ordered two appetizers the chef board and the fried calamari.  Both of these appetizers were lackluster.  The fried calamari wasn't light and easy to eat, instead it was chewy and overly breaded.  Our entrees took over an hour to arrive at the table, but when they did the quality was excellent.  That brings me to the good, the swordfish I ordered was clearly fresh, and the filet my wife ordered was cooked perfectly.   With a bit of fine tuning on the service, better appetizers that match freshness of entress this place would be 4 stars in my book, but without those elements it falls a bit short
Name: Chicken and Rice Guys; Review: Good food. Good quantity. Price is good for the amount of food available. Halal chicken is served with rice. It would be better if customers were able to choose between the type of salad they want with their order but overall a good experience
Name: Turner Fisheries Restaurant & Bar; Review: Our party of 6 went for drinks and appetizers in the bar early last Saturday evening.  Oysters and littleneck were fantastic, the drinks very good, and the service excellent.  One of the better fried calamari’s we’ve tasted and the chowder is wonderful","Name: Island Hopper; Review: Good service, good appetizers but the entree was so so...
Name: Seapoint; Review: First time here. Won't be the last. The bartender was very friendly. I ordered an appetizer, buffalo wing dings & a side salad (to go). The portion sizes were huge & the salad was very fresh. The atmosphere was great. It wasn't very busy but it had a warm, cozy feeling to it. I look forward to going back
Name: The Hen House Wings 'n Waffles; Review: Ordered from here using the Caviar app. Bad decision  I ordered potato skins and the appetizer sampler. The potato skins were either over cooked or not cooked enough because they were hard in some spots and chewy. They tasted like they had been sitting under a light all day with melted cheese and bacon added right before I ordered them. The chicken tenders were over cooked for sure. Super hard and tasted like cardboard. The chicken wings had absolutely no flavor. The only thing that tasted halfway decent was the mozzarella sticks, but they were pretty oily and greasy. I wasted $25 for sure
Name: Crave Chinatown; Review: Really good! Love how they have an extensive menu that tastes fresh and looks amazing! They also have a drinks menu that includes beer, martinis, cocktails, shots, and a scorpion bowl. Decently large place with decent space in between tables. Service is good but it can get busy on the weekends. People ranging from young to old come here and it's always lively! Bathrooms are in the back which are clean. Separate bathrooms for male and female. 1) Truffle fries with parmesan cheese - really good! Would definitely recommend. Warm and fresh. Super crunchy on the outside and soft potato on the inside. Comes with ketchup and chipotle mayo. Tip: dip the French fries in both sauces at the same time - tastes really good!! Rating: (5/5). 2) Fried rice with egg & chicken - a little too Americanized for me. Standard fried rice. Could use more seasoning overall. Rating: (2/5). 3) Salmon & Tuna Dumplings - REALLY good. It's basically shredded crabmeat and small chunks of lobster wrapped in raw salmon or raw tuna to look like a dumpling. Each dumpling is placed on a large spoon that has a ton of soy sauce on the bottom. The dumplings could do withOUT the soy sauce though. I would have preferred the soy sauce to be on the side so you could control how much soy sauce you're consuming. Regardless, it was still really good and would recommend. The dish includes 4 dumplings for $15. Rating: (4/5). 4) Hotate Hokkaiyaki - baked sea scallop in a large shell with crabmeat tobiko, enoki mushrooms, scallions topped with cheese and spicy mayo served sizzling on a burner. It looks cool and tastes good and fresh! But probably wouldn't get it again. Too much shredded crabmeat and you could really taste the mayo. However I couldn't taste the cheese (which I'm thankful for tbh). An interesting dish though. Dish costed $13. Rating: (4/5). 5) Fried Chicken - size: medium, which consisted of 10 drumsticks. There are around 6 different flavours on believe. We got Soy Garlic and Angry. Soy garlic is mild while Angry has a spicy kick to it (Sriracha spicy level). Chicken was super juicy and decently sized! The fried breading was really good - crunchy, well flavored, and not too oily. Would definitely recommend the soy garlic and definitely the fried chicken. Rating: (5/5)
Name: Domenic's; Review: 4 stars. Food was great, fabulous eggplant appetizer, meatballs were terrific.  Great presentation of chicken piccata with roasted  brussels sprouts and êxcellent potatoes. Interesting pâsta shapes w chicken parm. Nice fresh Caesar salad. A variety of cocktails...I liked the one with hibiscus. Only thing missing : no coffee & đêssert, but they are pretty nêw, maybe that will come in time, but in the North End, those never far away. Sorry I didn't take pictures of the food. Service was very attentive. I will go back","Name: Island Hopper; Review: Good service, good appetizers but the entree was so so...

Name: D'Parma Italian Cuisine; Review: Love this place! The pasta is amazing, awesome apps and they are open til like 1am.. Tonight I got the D'Parma salad, chicken cutlet, roasted red peppers, fresh Mozzarella cheese, cucumbers, tomatoes, red onion and lettuce with amazing house dressing, it was so good.. We also got the shrimp, scallop, crab Ravioli app. It was very small but so good. I Love the amazing fresh baked bread that they serve with oil for dipping.. I load it up with cheese and crush red pepper, its so good. I also love the subs.. the Chicken Parm and Meatball parm are pretty amazing

Name: Taproom Bar & Grill; Review: Drove out from Milford MA (just a bit over an hour) after googling a place to meet up with a friend. The alcohol drinks were not bad. Our appetizer mozzarella sticks were perfect as was the sauce and the burgers looked so good we didn't even want to touch it. Luckily it tasted as good as it looked. Seems like it had a seasoning to it which put some flavor in it. Those seasoned fries too were amazing. Our waitress with the blonde hair did a great job. Very friendly and attentive. Give her a raise! We will come back agai

Name: Fool's Errand; Review: I LOVE what they’ve got going here. Chef Faison’s concept is so great here - excellently crafted drinks and just plain-ol great snacks. They’re not afraid to serve you raclette, beautiful bread and fresh whipped butter, nor do they shy away from something bougie like caviar, but they’re not afraid to dish it out with a single-serving size bag of classic Lays chips. I love the juxtaposition! It’s so welcoming, like it’s just great drinks and great snacks and everything is just grounded in what tastes good! Also, highest rated bathroom in Boston by far, so how can one not like this place","Name: The Met Back Bay; Review: Two stars because the food was good, but the service sucks. I went on Sunday after work, I was sitting on the patio.I had a order of calamari that was awesome and later I had one of the burger that was good. The server didn't know what beers are in the house, I asked for one Belgium beer and they didn't have it, then the server came back ten minutes later to say that they don't have that beer, then I asked about what kind of beer is the seasonal of Sam Adams, he said ""summer"", that's not a kind of beer. After the drink, I wanted one appetizer and the main course, so I asked my server about some recommendations. He just showed me the menu again. Afterwards, I asked him about the size of the calamari, he said that it is just an appetizer, and it would be ok  if I have it as an appetizer. When it came, it was too big just for one, specially if I am going to have a burger later. At the end he just dropped the check without asking if I'm going to have something else, and I wanted a dessert and another beer. So disappointed about this place

Name: Buttermilk & Bourbon; Review: Fantastic place with some of the best staff and food I've had in the city - I had B+B on my ""to go"" list for close to a year and finally got around to it! Made reservations for Friday night (as you should for any restaurant in that area) and everything was exceptional! Big thanks to Roy, our server Sam, and all the other staff who were attentive and kind to our party. Between the 5 of us we tried the highly recommended blackened octopus, the oysters, the french onion macaroni and cheese, the spicy fried cauliflower, the Nashville hot chicken thighs, the chicken wings, the biscuits, and the beignets. Every single plate was delicious!! The cauliflower was crispy and paired with a great creamy sauce, the mac and cheese was baked well and oozing with flavor inside, the octopus was very flavorful and wasn't overcooked, and both the wings and thighs were fought over! And the biscuits... there aren't words to describe how perfectly crispy and sweet they were on top and how salty and fluffy they were on the inside and on top of it all they're MASSIVE and paired with a great cinnamon butter dip and another cheese dip that we took to go. The beignets were equally as tantalizing - super soft and sweet and on second thought we should've ordered a second plate of them to bring home...The drinks were all exceptional too, ask for whatever is popular - can't remember all the names but we ran through 3 or different 4 mixes (the whodi smash was the last one I had - its strong and made with Woodford bourbon 🙂) I can't say enough good things about this place - just go, eat, and enjoy

Name: Sawa Hibachi Steakhouse and Sushi; Review: Food Court quality at dine-in prices , we ordered 4 dinners and 4 appetizers to test the menu place was semi empty food came almost too quickly  a bad sign the appetizers were underwhelming amd the real disappointment was the dinners , swimming in Sugary syrup were soggy vegetables and cold microwave rice , decorations were swanky hookah bar theme in a japanese steak house , no wagu beef  choices no imagination and bad execution, I am done with mall eateries that disguise themselves as big city high quality nuveau cuisine when its only a panda express at best go if you ilke a low key private setting since you’re the only one there ar

Name: Les Zygomates Wine Bar & Bistro; Review: So apparently Zygomates is under new ownership with a new chef and I was lucky enough to be invited to taste their menu and besides for a few small misses the meal was a hit. The staff was phenomenal and did a great job explaining the dishes as they were dropped off to the table, which in my opinion doesn't happen enough in higher end restaurants. Les Zygomates is also in the middle of a renovation and from what was completed it looked pretty sharp.  Here is what I tasted:  Charcuterie - Great little board with a focus on duck. Duck pastrami and the pate were great  House made duck confit nuggets - I was just able to try one of these. Great concept, as someone who loves duck I think these were spot on. Crunchy on the outside and flavorful on the inside  Smoked Salmon - This was a highlight of the meal and I'm not usually a smoked salmon fan. It was served on top of a chip and I found it very flavorful  Poached Shrimp - This was also served on some type of chip, it was good but I thought it was just good shrimp on a chip  southeast Asian Mussels - Another highlight of the meal. I think the whole table was caught off guard at how good these tasted and the presentation. The curry and coconut flavors were perfect but not overpowering.  Gnocchi in a Garlic Cream Sauce w/ Escargot and Lamb Bacon - This was hands down my favorite dish. I wasn't sure if I would dig the lamb bacon but it helped perfect the complex flavor profile. The fresh gnocchi's were almost slightly crispy which I enjoyed.  Lobster Bisque - I've never had lobster bisque with a puff pastry on top but it was a welcome addition. There were a few chunks of lobster in there as well.  Bone in Veal - While I wouldn't normally order giant hunks of meat while at dinner if this is your style then this is a killer dish. The veal had a great crust that was just crispy enough and flavorful. It was cooked perfectly medium rare.  Creme Brulee - Not much else to say other than it was a perfect rendition of this classic dessert  Lemon Souffle - I never tried a lemon souffle before but I really enjoyed the tart and fruity flavors of this dish. Seems like a great palette cleanser to end a meal.  Baked Alaska - One of the best presented dishes of the night. They lit it on fire tableside. As far as taste goes I found it a little too boozey and thought the chocolate ice cream inside wasn't a good fi"
Where can I find good cocktails?,"Name: Fool's Errand; Review: Chic but relaxed bar serving up craft cocktails and gourmet snacks. Owned by the same chef of Tiger Mama and Sweet Cheeks; the same attention to food and cocktails is highlighted by their giant chalkboard sign menu.  The fortified wine cocktails are fun and interesting. No table service as this is just a small bar. This place typically draws a crowd every Friday and Saturday night. Food menu is all snacks, do not expect a full menu (adult snack bar is in the name.. duh). Service is top notch, even when crowded. Definitely a must for a quick drink in the Fenway neighborhood
Name: Forum; Review: I stopped in here for a pre-duck tour snack with a friend and we loved the cocktails: Tom Collins and Moscow Mule. We also had appetizers, mine being a short rib egg roll and while it was delicious, it was so heavy. Too heavy before sitting down for ages. Otherwise, this is a pretty nice place to go to for after-work cocktails or even to host a small birthday celebration
Name: Better Sorts Social Club; Review: A little bit noisier than my eyes told me from pictures (I realize that's on me and ridiculous). But holy cow, cocktails. Our bar tenders were amazing and made some high quality cocktails that kept my group very happy for several hours. Classy joint, dark bathrooms, out of this world bar tenders, louder than ideal music, comfy bar chairs
Name: Blue Inc.; Review: Great spot for funky cocktails and delicious eats. Have boozy adult milkshakes which are a must
Name: Avila; Review: We stumble in here every once in a while for cocktails or apps. Try the Fried Goat Cheese Balls - AMAZING! Any of their cocktails are great, and some are pretty unique in terms of flavor. Skip the ""New Fashioned"" and stick with the old one, though... Service in here is great, and though the place as a whole looks upscale, you're fine in nice jeans at the bar. Don't expect to watch the game on any huge TVs, but do expect great conversation with the staff as well as the many regulars that frequent the bar for dinner (Park Plaza is right there...and the folks that live there seem to be unable to cook their own meals ;-)","Name: Forum; Review: I stopped in here for a pre-duck tour snack with a friend and we loved the cocktails: Tom Collins and Moscow Mule.

Name: The Boston Shaker; Review: This shop ROCKS! I am just getting into cocktails, and Boston Shaker is EXACTLY the spot I need to put together a world-class bar. You can buy their pre-made kits (that don't include the liquor), or they're more than happy to give you recommendations on which stirring spoon is right for you. They have an INSANE amount of bitters, too, so make sure you try them (mix in with the soda water they have available). Also, books and cocktail recipes galore! And cocktail making classes
Name: Minibar; Review: The interior decor and specialty cocktails made this bar very Miami-esque. I found the drink prices reasonable, because I don't mind paying for creative concoctions with a kick. But I bet others would find them overpriced. The actual bar is quite small so I'd imagine it takes a little while to get a drink when the place is crowded. But overall I would recommend this lounge-style location for its ambiance and fun liquors
Name: Bar 10; Review: Great service, great food, great beer and cocktails. Friendly bartender went out of his way to be available and accomodate my requests (ordering room service-only food at the bar, asking for a cocktail recommendation). Highly recommended. Medium price point
Name: Explorateur Cafe, Restaurant & Bar; Review: I was at Exploratuer last Saturday with my wife before a Christmas party. We both had cocktails,  she an Espresso Martini and I had an L Street Informant. Both cocktails were spot on and delicious.  Fast forward to this past Thursday, I went back in for a beer before an event I had to go to. The bar tender remembered me  and the cocktail that I had and asked if I wanted another. Pretty impressive for such a busy place.  The guys were slammed on Thursday afternoon. They were spot on making detailed drinks flawlessly.  Most impressive is the quality of the bartenders and second to that is quality of the ingredients.  My go to place for a good beer or outstanding drink when I'm in the area.  The cafe offers great pastries to bring home. Never been let down. The kids who work there seem like Political Science majors; but with $12.00 bucks an hour coming their way - nothing can stop them now.

Name: Better Sorts Social Club; Review: Best cocktails around!  The space is so luxe - ambient lighting, plush furniture, crystal glassware... a truly upscale experience.  They have seasonal cocktails (as well as year-round), an extensive wine & liquor list, and food/snacks.  It's the perfect place to relax with a cocktail and friends or a date.  They also have spirit-free cocktail options which came in handy for my pregnant friend.  I bring all my out-of-town guests here.  We had a hard time finding it the first time - the doors to enter are right on Tremont street.  Highly recommend

Name: The Boston Shaker; Review: This smartly-designed Davis Square shop stocks just about everything you need to craft perfect drinks at home or on-the-job at a professional bar. Don't be fooled by the modest size of this boutique; inside lies an emporium-like inventory of bitters, glassware, and cocktail books.  Adam and his staff are incredibly knowledgeable and enthusiastic about what they do. Whether you're in search of a gift, in need of basics for cocktailing at home, or looking for the latest addition to your professional bar arsenal, they'll be sure to steer you in the right direction.  No booze? No problem - you won't need to go far. Dave's Fresh Pasta, just steps away, carries an impressive selection of vermouth and aperitif liqueurs. Meanwhile, Downtown Wine & Spirits, also nearby, boasts a great selection of full-strength spirits

Name: Merrill & Co.; Review: The space is updated from the 28 Degrees decor, with the new layout both making it more open while also increasing the number of distinct, comfortable spaces within the restaurant. There's a small but solid craft beer selection, really great comfort food in shareable plates, and excellent cocktails. This is a laid back spot off the beaten path, but it's walkable from Boylston and Back Bay bars - and worth the trek if you're looking for something friendly, comfortable and still classy enough for solid cocktails"
Italian restaurants nearby,"Name: La Galleria 33; Review: They need Gordon Ramsey to come back.  When entering the host was wearing a hoodie.  As we walked through the North End we had a concern because all of the restaurants were full and seemed very busy.  Not the case upon our arrival at La Galleria.  There was only 3 or 4 other tables with guests.  The overwhelming smell of this Italian restaurant is not garlic, fresh tomatoes or the essence of fine Italian food being cooked, for example the smells one enjoys while walking by the nearby restaurants.  What do you smell from the open kitchen?  The fryer that smells like old oil, Ugh.  The quality and freshness of the food (muscles, tomatoes on Brushetta, Halibut) was excellent.  However, the preparation was nothing you would go out of your way for.  The burning question would I go back, probably not.  If you are in Boston for only a few days  this is not as expensive as other nearby places the food is OK and you should be able to get a reservation.  If your looking for authentic Italian food, this is not the place.  It is neither romantic or funky.  They had a TV on the wall with a basket ball game and kind of indy rock on the stereo.  It was just really odd and wouldn't want to dine here with friends as it isn't a warm comfortable place even though the exposed brick was warm and welcomin
Name: Coolidge Market; Review: Was skeptical about the outside of the place but a friend told me that the Italian sub is the best. For $4.50 you can get the best Italian sub in the city. It was absolutely delicious, and made with love by a little old woman. 100000% recommend. Although I am sad that no other Italian sandwich will compare
Name: Punto Rojo; Review: The best Colombian restaurant I have been in this country !! I live in NY and I came to visit Boston and this place really made me happy with its food and good service, the price for the quality and quantity of food is more than perfect !! I looked at many Reviews of restaurants nearby and this was the best and the best choice! All very tasty!
Name: Casalinga; Review: Being an Italian raised in East Boston I rarely find authentic Italian cuisine when I dine out. This is not the case at Casalinga. The arincinis ( rice balls ) are delicious, the lobster ravioli tender and flavorful, and the eggplant parmesan wonderful. Superb quality Italian cooking at a very reasonable price. A hidden gem
Name: Oliver Street Cafe; Review: I've honestly never had an Italian sub like this one. It will change your life","Name: D'Parma Italian Cuisine; Review: Stopped by at midnight after picking a friend up at nearby Logan Airport. Late-night food is in desperately short supply in Boston, particularly decent sit-down civilized restaurant style. This was a great find.  I had the Salad D'Parma with steak tips, he the Fettuccine Alfredo with chicken and broccoli - both were excellent. We also appreciated the waitress regularly checking in that everything was going well.  Glad to now have a great goto in East Boston
Name: Linguine's Italian Eatery; Review: My go-to lunch spot in Marlboro. They have great pasta dishes, subs (love the chicken parmesan!), pizza, and traditional Italian chicken/veal dishes. I usual get a salad that can be topped with grilled chicken, but they will slice a breaded chicken breast instead upon request. The homemade house thick creamy Italian dressing is the best I've found anywhere, and they serve everything with warm pizza dough rolls. Even watching carbs, I can't help but dip a roll in the dressing.  My other favorite lunch is in the winter, they often have either chicken escarole or escarole bean soup (larger bowl). Both are packed with chicken/veggies/beans.  During the day, you order at the counter, and seat yourself. I believe they have wait service at night. I look forward to the days I work in Marlboro just for the Linguine's lunch
Name: Alfredo's Italian Kitchen/SOUTH BOSTON; Review: Okay, our first night in Boston we looked up places to get great Italian food. Yelp rated this place as far and they were like over a thousand reviews so of course that's where we headed. Little did we know that it's just a stand on the corner of two streets and it's only pick up or carry out, we had no clue. So we left that place on our first night although the menu looked phenomenal and the smell was amazing. However The night before we left we returned and picked up some pizza. It was delicious. I think if I lived in Boston or had more time in Boston I would have been there more frequently. It did look like there were several little shops like this one, this one was just near our b&b and caught our attention. As long as you're okay with just take out or delivery, this is a place I would recommend
Name: Artu; Review: I try not to eat at the same restaurant twice in the North End, but Artu may need an exemption from this rule. My date and I both agreed that the food was fantastic Sat night. Appetizer was a ricotta wrapped in eggplant, for dinner she ordered the Fusilli e Salsicce con Broccoli Rabe with Sausage and I got the Pollo Arrabiata. The appetizer was definitely the highlight of the evening. For dinner: pasta was perfectly cooked, my chicken dish was spicy, sauces were not too thick/watery and the portions were a reasonable size (nothing left for lunch the next day). No valet parking for Artu, I valeted my car @Mamma Maria for $25. I'd highly recommend
Name: 5 North Square; Review: We had a delightful lunch of individual real Italian pizzas.  The dough was thin, ingredients fresh, service good and attentive.  Wine list adequate.  Nice street view with plenty local color.  Complimentary bread to dip in seasoned oil was a nice touch","Name: Linguine's Italian Eatery; Review: My go-to lunch spot in Marlboro. They have great pasta dishes, subs (love the chicken parmesan!), pizza, and traditional Italian chicken/veal dishes. I usual get a salad that can be topped with grilled chicken, but they will slice a breaded chicken breast instead upon request. The homemade house thick creamy Italian dressing is the best I've found anywhere, and they serve everything with warm pizza dough rolls. Even watching carbs, I can't help but dip a roll in the dressing.  My other favorite lunch is in the winter, they often have either chicken escarole or escarole bean soup (larger bowl). Both are packed with chicken/veggies/beans.  During the day, you order at the counter, and seat yourself. I believe they have wait service at night. I look forward to the days I work in Marlboro just for the Linguine's lunch

Name: Alfredo's Italian Kitchen/SOUTH BOSTON; Review: Okay, our first night in Boston we looked up places to get great Italian food. Yelp rated this place as far and they were like over a thousand reviews so of course that's where we headed. Little did we know that it's just a stand on the corner of two streets and it's only pick up or carry out, we had no clue. So we left that place on our first night although the menu looked phenomenal and the smell was amazing. However The night before we left we returned and picked up some pizza. It was delicious. I think if I lived in Boston or had more time in Boston I would have been there more frequently. It did look like there were several little shops like this one, this one was just near our b&b and caught our attention. As long as you're okay with just take out or delivery, this is a place I would recommend

Name: Maurizio's; Review: My favorite Italian restaurant on Planet Earth. Don't believe me? Try Maurizio's Involtini di Melanzane (rolled slices of eggplant stuffed with ricotta cheese, basil, sun dried tomatoes and parmesan cheese, topped with tomato sauce) as an appetizer, and then the Linguine ai Frutti di Mare (shrimp, scallops, clams, mussels and calamari served in a spicy lobster based tomato sauce and tossed with linguine) as a main course.  Ask Linda to choose a bottle of wine for you. Maurizio's food is proof of the existence of God. Period

Name: Dino's Cafe; Review: This small little gem in North Boston's Little Italy has to be tasted.  It's more of a take out business then sit down spot, but the place is so quaint and oozes Italian flare, you should grab a seat. You won't get diligent server assistance as they are geared to take out.  But the food is sooo good you won't care.  The chef/cook couldn't be more pleased to have you at Dinos.  I had fettuccine with sausage in garlic cream sauce.  I was offered extra bread for the A+ sauce. Amazing food for some of the BEST prices in Boston.  Try it","Name: Papa's Pizza Company; Review: My family and I were in town last week visiting relatives and they decided one night to order out pizza.  They knew of Papa's and highly recommended it.  Boy, were they right!  The pizza got there quick, it was HOT, and it was incredible!  We ordered two extra larges (Margherita and Meat Lover) and everyone loved them!  The crusts and sauce were wonderful. (It took me back to my younger days when we would go out Sunday after church to our favorite Italian restaurant in Cleveland).  So I decided before we came home, I would have to take the family there to eat.  We arrived and though it was busy, we were seated immediately by a very courteous, friendly host.  Our server got to us quickly and got our drinks while making some suggestions for my wife and I as well as the kids.  Just like the take-out pizza, in in-house food was perfect as well!  Chicken Alfredo, Strawberry Walnut Salad, Meatball Sub, and my one kid actually ordered a Steak Teriyaki Bowl (at an italian restaurant????) and I was shocked at how good it was!  Even the Assistant Manager Konstantine came by to see how everything was.  He was a very nice young man.  Service was spot on without being overbearing.  Wish I could bring this place down to FL with me as well as give it more stars than just five

Name: Mario's Restaurant; Review: Mario's looks like the quintessential local Italian restaurant-- exposed brick walls, checkered table cloths, and a menu full of Italian comfort food.  After eating here twice, I find that it is really a disappointment. The food is suprisingly pricy considering the neighborhood and the interior of the restaurant. $17 for a pasta dish, anything with meat runs around $20, and seafood can top out next to $30. I don't mind paying that kind of money for good Italian food having grown up in Providence, but the food wasn't that much to write home about.  The pasta was overcooked, the razor-thin pounded veal lacked flavor and was soggy. The lobster in the pasta special was a bit rubbery. I know others have had a great experience at this restaurant, but for a local, casual Italian restaurant, the food isn't nearly good enough to justify prices that belong more in the North End than Eastie

Name: Rino's Place; Review: WoW, WoW, WoW! Every dish I got tonight was absolutely fabulous and when they came, they FLOOD! The wait was over two hours long on a Friday night by 8pm, so come early or come on a weekday!  Here's the gist: Get here, sign in, leave your number, go find a bar nearby, drink, wait, receive a call, and EAT!  The restaurant is small to keep the quality here as high as possible to the owner's desire. You will absolutely be stuffed coming out of this restaurant, so get one less dish than you think you want to order.  My order and take on it: CALAMARI - calamari battered & fried and finished in a spicy pepper ring sauce $12 (OMG, the best calamari I have ever had because the taste is sooo complete! There's is no marinara or any sort of sauce needed for this dish. I don't know what it is, but the spicy pepper ring brings this dish a whole level up. Don't be scared, it's not spicy at all!)  VITELLO MARSALA - scallopini of veal sauteed with mushrooms and ham. Finished in a marsala wine sauce $12 (Veal is beaten down to a pulp with a layer of ham on top and another layer of cheese on top of that. It's so tender! Marsala sauce is perfect with this...if you don't want to carbo load, get any of the Marsala dishes depending what kind of meat you're craving for...yum!  GNOCCHI - homemade potato dumplings sauteed in a fresh plum tomato sauce and topped with fresh mozzarella and baked $15 (OMG, I could make this dish into four meals...it's so filling, but so worth it! The dish is perfectly cheesy and bouncy!)  LOBSTER RAVIOLI - Their star dish of Rino's and featured on FOOD network. It's absolutely the best lobster ravioli I have ever had and it's something you must get and share among your party. DO IT!  Frutti Di Mare - Seafood overload beyond belief. They do not skimp on their portion on this dish and it's so fresh! You get to pick whatever type of pasta you desire to complement this dish and I went with the fusilli pasta, yum!  Tiramisu - Perfect end to the meal and it's so creamy and delicious! You might as well pair it off with a cup of cappuccino or coffee :)  Overall, my dinner was a phenomenal experience at Rino's. I'm glad I got to try this restaurant and I can't wait to come back to Rino's sometime soon again.  PS. Parking is a pain here because it's packed in the residential area of Boston East, so carpool or take the T. The walk from the T is a bit far to Rino's, but it's doable!  Close on Sunday, hours below: Monday: 4pm - 9pm / Tuesday - Thursday: 11am - 9pm / Friday: 11am - 10pm / Saturday: 3pm - 10p

Name: Pini's Pizzeria; Review: This place really does have the best pizza in town and probably surrounding towns, although I can't confirm. Their delivery is really fast too. I forget about this place especially since I'm not driving by it every day but when I remember it exists and I want pizza this is definitely my go-to. The only ""issue"" is that outside of pizza their menu is pretty limited. My wife has a dairy allergy and doesn't like red sauce so she doesn't eat pizza much and if she does she gets one without cheese and sauce (Bianca) which she really likes but that's really the only thing she would like on the menu. Because of that, if we order takeout we need to order from a place that has a larger selection of subs/wraps/salads

Name: Babbo Pizzeria e Enoteca; Review: Wow we had the salads...pizzas and pastas. Now we're a party of 18, difficulty to please straight up Italians. Salad...arugula and tomato (tomatoes were incredible), summer Caesar = awesome. Pizzas: margarita was top notch, calabrese wowwww even got a vegan to try and was definitely not upset she ate the sausage. Zucchini pizza was fantastic also.  Nowwww the pastas!!! Again we are Italians we make our own pasta this was unreal.  Tagliatelle Bolognese some said was their favorite, others said the rock shrimp pasta with corn was theirs . Then we got the buccatini with guancele...game changer. Deserts? Yes please unreal like we made our own...  Again we don't give out this rating for Italian food this easily, in fact we never eat Italian out because we're disappointed that we could make it better at home. Nope not this time....we will be back and you are insane if you don't consider going here as a top choice in Boston"
Where can I find sushi?,"Name: Ginza Japanese; Review: Great place for Boston Sushi
Name: Basho Sushi; Review: Good sushi good price
Name: LoLa 42 Boston; Review: If I could give negative start, I would. Your overpriced sushi taste similar or worst than a cheap supermarket sushi. You should change your chef, because he/she obviously doesn't know what the real sushi taste like. I would never mind paying the  fancy price for a good food, but let's face the fact that your food doesn't deserve the price. I've been to many upscale sushi restaurants around the world, noting taste as awful as your sushi, especially for the price, 3 rolls + miso soup for $120.. Ridiculous for the quality. I would not pay $5 for your sushi, if I only knew it would be this awful
Name: Gogo Ya; Review: For Boston, this is top rate Sushi
Name: Symphony Sushi; Review: Every time I go to a new restaurant, I try to find the menu item that'll be my go-to in the future. Symphony Sushi is very close to where I live, and it has been for years now, so of course it has preference over other sushi places for that reason. Time and time again I've tried to find something, anything on the menu that I think is actually worth ordering again. I haven't found a single thing. I've ordered something different almost every time I've gone, and nothing has taken my heart. Everything has been perfectly mediocre. I hate to talk about my exes, but back in Albany I had a sushi place called Sushi Tei that I was absolutely smitten with. The prices were good, and the sushi was so tasty it was unreal. But Albany isn't known for its sushi, so I figured a city like Boston would have its standards a lot higher, right? Symphony Sushi hasn't given me anything that's measured up, despite my many attempts to give it another chance. If you're just craving sushi in general and you're local like I am, this is your place. But if you want something with more substance, something that'll actually wow you, you'll have to look elsewhere. I'm sorry. :","Name: New Sushi Inc; Review: Kind of a build your own Sushi Bowl place. I think Chipotle, but with sushi. Fish was fresh, sauces were delicious, and my order was accurate. I ordered online, and the pickup was seamless. There's not much seating in the restaurant itself, it shares a spot with a defunct Dunkin Donuts and a sub shop. Definitely not a place you'd want to go if you want to sit down and have a meal, but it's excellent if you want a quick little lunch on your break at work. I'm glad I found it! Definitely get the crispy garlic on top
Name: State Street Sushi; Review: The sushi was fresh - but not exceptional. Basically a very high grade of supermarket sushi made quickly and at a reasonable price. There are only 4 seats at the counter, but most people seem to get carryout anyway! Our order took about 5 minutes after it was placed and the line moved along quickly. Also, if you're pressed for time, they have pre-made trays. The lunch specials are definitely the best value
Name: Snappy Sushi; Review: <There is no sushi restaurant series in Boston.> March 17 travel destination visit. There are also shops that are not Japanese-owned sushi shops in the US, so make sure that the manager is Japanese before visiting. On the 1st floor, the group customers were main, so sushi was only at the BF counter. Beer will only be Samuel Adams Boston Lager since he came to Boston ❗ The knob is kimchi tofu. However, cold tofu that came out is what tofu! Well, why not silk? The craftsman was Mexican, but this is the reality of an American sushi restaurant.  It was cold and I was also inspired by the ramen that was on the menu, but after all I could not eat sushi and my identity as a Japanese would be lost. I asked for Spicy Scallop Roll to try a little different species.  I paid attention to the arrangement because I love scallops, but with a medium finish, I managed to recover tofu. Accounting is $ 31.99 without tip.
Name: T Sushi & Noodles; Review: Although at first it would seem like a very simple sushi stand, you would be surprised by how fresh and tasty their rolls are (Spicy salmon)!! They also have a BOGO 50% off from 4-8 pm. Now I can have a great sushi on a work day
Name: Douzo Sushi; Review: Another sushi place in my US stay. This place is very close to Boston Back Bay Station, so you can get there very easily and it is not very far from the downtown.  The restaurant is somehow big, when you first enter through two doors, staff will attend you and take you to your sitting. They have both table and lounge areas, so maybe they will ask you which one you prefer, as I was one person I chose to sit down in the bar area.  The bar area has the typical bar, with some tall chairs and small tables for two people ( they can be grouped ) and some TV screens with sports or random stuff.  There are some kinds of Sake and Japanese beer, other than the usual ones. In the menu I only looked for sushi-style food, there are sushi, rolls, maki and sashimi among others.  I chose some with tuna, salmon and yellowfish, and they were very fresh and tasty. It's not the best sushi I've ever had, but it was really good, it was prepared when ordered.  The wasabi was also very good, it mixed really well with the soy sauce and the flavour was awesome, very spicy tho.  The service was also very good, I asked for some advice and what they recommend me was the best ( Yellowfish )","Name: New Sushi Inc; Review: Kind of a build your own Sushi Bowl place.

Mexican food around here,"Name: Pueblo Viejo; Review: El Pueblo Viejo makes the most delicious pupusas I’ve tasted so far here in Massachusetts. This is my family’s first option for pupusas. But I’ve also tried some of their Mexican dishes, I’d say their Mexican dishes are not typical Mexican food it’s more like Taco Bell. However, this is a great restaurant to take your family. Great service, the ladies are always polite and attentive. I wish I could give 5 stars but you guys need to improve on your Mexican dishes. I do recommend this restaurant
Name: Casa Romero; Review: Came here for a very early dinner around 5 PM on a Sunday. This place is accessible via an alley and the first thing you noticed the beautiful door. You walk downstairs to a heavily-decorated Mexican restaurant with all the decor from Mexico. It has a very traditional Mexican restaurant feel.  FOOD: Seemed to be a little bit more authentic than your average Mexican food restaurant. We realized that since we arrived before 6 and would leave by 7 that we could order the early bird special which has 3 courses for $24. I was hungry so I went for it.  Marinated Chicken Wings with Mole Sauce - These chicken wings were on the fattier side but the sauce was rich and delicious. This also came with fried plantains on top which was a nice sweet element. I LOVE fried plantains.  Pulled Roasted Pork (aka Cochinita Pibil) - SO delicious. Perfect balance of a little spicy with very savory. The meat was so tender. I wish I could have eaten this all night.  Mexican-Style Crepes - not sure what makes this Mexican besides the caramel on top but this is also filled with sliced bananas. Came with a side of vanilla ice cream. Delicious and wish I had more.  Portions were on the smaller side compared to other Mexican restaurants, though that may have been because it was part of the early bird special. I would definitely come back for the early bird special.  Tip: If you order before 6 and leave before 7, get the early bird special. $24 for 3 courses. What a deal! Keep that in mind if you are hungry one afternoon in Back Bay
Name: Burro Bar South End; Review: Came here with a group of 7 friends on a Friday night without reservations. They have a big bar as well as a lounge area that is first come first served so if you don't have a reservation, you can still get a seat relatively quickly if are lucky.  AMBIANCE: very lively, one of the most fun nights I've had in Boston.  SERVICE: pretty good, they accidentally brought us 2 Mexican Ice Cream Sundaes and gave us the second one for free so that was a nice plus.  FOOD: not too big of a menu for a Mexican restaurant but it has something for everyone. My friends seemed to like their kale salad and short rib tacos (the latter of which did seem small for $7) but I had the street cart chicken, one of my favorite things to get at Mexican restaurants. It's a well-cooked, well-spiced half chicken with Mexican rice and fried plantains. Hearty and filling, a nice balance of sweet and spicy.  For dessert, we had the Mexican Ice Cream Sundae which was my favorite thing we got. Three different ice creams: chipotle chocolate, coconut avocado, and dulce de leche. Then it's topped with horchata whipped cream, Marcona almonds, caramelized plantains, and tequila soaked cherries. I could have eaten this whole thing by myself but unfortunately I had to share.  Overall, burro bar was great for a casual night out with friends but I definitely want to try and check out some other South End restaurants before coming bac
Name: Tenoch Mexican; Review: I want places that attempt to be real Mexican food to survive in Boston, so I'm rating Tenoch a little higher than it deserves. This is about as close to authentic as I've seen in Boston, but it still leaves something to be desired. I'm a greasy sandwich junkie, so tortas are one of my favorite Mexican foods. This torta was OK. All the toppings were there, but the meat wasn't well seasoned and the telera bread was limp without the crunch it should have on the outside. I'll go again because there's nowhere for a torta fix—until I leave the Mexican food desert that is the Northeast
Name: El Pelón Taqueria; Review: This place was a HAVEN in a Mexican-food desert in Boston. I tried so hard to find Mexican food comparable to what I'm used to as a native Texan, and trust me - there were a lot of failures. I brought my brother to this place as a break from his first year of college, and was pleasantly surprised that it was tiny, but packed!! The smell was INTOXICATING, and I could barely wait to order!! The choice was easy to make - El Guapo all the way. Plantains inside of a burrito? GENIUS. The best part was that the fried plantains just elevated the flavor of an already amazing burrito - the grilled steak, mexican rice, black beans, salsa, lettuce, and crema were perfectly en pointe. And the wait was short, even with a long line!  I've trekked out here in rain, snow, busy days after work - it's worth it! While the food is super authentic, the decor is really eclectic and cozy - there's so much to look at! The whole history of the place is written on the walls and is a great conversation starter.  I dream of coming back, and I highly recommend! Super affordable, excellent Mexican food","Name: Mexican Restaurant, Mini Buffet; Review: I visit this Place when I come to Downtown..

Name: Herrera's Mexican Grill; Review: Visiting Boston, MA for the first time. Asked locals what to check out- they recommended this. So glad they did!

Also- they have plenty of salsas to choose from

Name: La Hacienda; Review: My family and I are from Texas where Mexican restaurants are a staple. We recently moved to the Boston area and have been searching for good Mexican, or Latin food type of restaurant. I found this place on Google maps and saw that it had nearly 1200 reviews and a rating of 4.5 stars. So I took my family to this place on a Saturday night with high hopes. We first walked in and stood at the hostess podium waiting for a few minutes for someone to greet then sit us. After a couple of minutes a staff member walked up, gave a half smile to us and walked away without saying anything. Finally a middle aged gentleman came and sat us. A server finally came by out table to ask what we wanted to drink and dropped off the chips and salsa. The server wasnt very friendly, she didnt offer to tell us anything about the restaurant or the menu. We ordered a couple of margaritas from their drink menu. While waiting for the drinks I tried the chips and salsa. My god I've never seen salsa with so many chunks of white onion. The Salsa literally was chunks of white onion and tomato sauce. The chips were stale. Got out margaritas. Not impressed. They tasted like like juice, soap water, and cheap tequila. The children's menu only offers, hot dogs, cheese burger and chicken fingers or wings... what kind of mexican restaurant doesnt offer any type of mexican dish on their Children's menu? I had to pay $9.00 for a cheese quesadilla off the regular menu for my daughter. It was so disgusting that she wouldn't even eat it.. and this girl loves cheese. Our server never came back by to check on us, or ask us if we would like another drink.  Although she came by once after my wife's food was dropped off to ask us how our meals were. Only problem is that my daughter and I were still waiting to receive our food. She was completely oblivious to the fact that there were no plates of food in front of us. I guess that worked better because if she would have asked us when we actually had our food, then I would have told her it was no better than ""ok"". We had to litterally ask another server to help us. If you are looking for a good experience or even just decent food... try else where. I miss Papasitos and Uncle Julios back in Texas

Name: Mexicali Sushi Bar; Review: Mexican style sushi, I get the chance to try the “Chiles Güeros” (Caribbean peppers stuffed with cream cheese and shrimp wrapped in bacon)... they were for lack of a better word were just perfect! Then I had the seafood tower and the aguachile shrimp.. both excellent! But my favorite of the night was the Mexicali sushi roll! All around everything was super good plus the hibiscus water and the cucumber water were legit like if you had ordered one from the “michoacana” (Mexican juice stop). Definitely coming back very very soon

The cheese for the tortilla chips (cardboard and tasteless) came as a greasy hard block of something that resembled something of a mozzarella/white American cheese blend you might find on a bad pizza. Not  anywhere close to a Mexican ques . Should not be served anywhere. The chimichanga was greasy ground beef with questionable vegetables and strange seasonings. The dough was tough, tasteless and soggy in the middle. After spending 15 years in Houston and trying all kinds of tex-mex, this was by far the very worst. SOOOO disappointing! Has the chef and cooking staff ever tried good tex-mex? This really isnt a matter of preference in prep or seasoning, it just us really not tex-mex at all! On a crazy side note...why is there rap music being played in a Mexican restaurant? Seriously?? Ugh"
I'm craving pizza,"Name: Union Park Pizza; Review: I had your pizza, buffalo chicken, for the first time yesterday at the Boston Pizza Fest. HANDS DOWN, THE BEST BUFFALO CHICKEN PIZZA EVER!! I don't ever wake up craving for pizza, but I did today! And I would have never known if you hadn't participated at the festival.  Thank you for being there! I will now have to make the trip to visit your shop, can't wait!
Name: Pepperoni Express; Review: My wife and I moved from the west coast and we've been looking for a pizza joint like this since we got here. After over a dozen attempts we've finally found it. The pizza here hits the spot. It's the right blend of good cheese, good sauce, and most importantly, good crust. New York style has its place but it doesn't have the craving-to-gluttonous-fill factor that makes you want to eat the whole pizza, sometimes with success, even though you were full after the second slice. This pizza tastes great for dinner and then cold for the next three meals. If you're wanting a satisfying yet possibly painful pizza experience, grab a pizza here. You won't be dissapointed. Also the garlic cheese bread is amazing
Name: Post Road Pizza; Review: Wonderful pizza. I get the same thing every time, a large cheese pizza. I honestly don’t know if anything else on the menu is any good because I just love the pizza so much. So it’s what I end up getting every time. Definitely recommend giving this pizza a try if you haven’t yet
Name: The Pizza Shuttle; Review: EXTREME FOODIE HARD PLEASE WHEN IT COMES TO FOOD!  I was craving pizza all day and decided to go with shuttle. I'm hooked on their international pizza.. Tonight I wanted something different. I called and expressed I wanted something different. The guy was very engaged and pleasant I felt like a valued patron. He recommend the chicken fajita pizza!  DEFINITELY A GREAT RECOMMENDATION!  I. LOVE THIS PIZZA!  NO CANNED VEGGIES AND TENDER CHICKEN MOUTH FULL OF BLISS! Arrived quickly. I loved it so much I had to call .even though they were closed they answered!  If you want great pizza and great service I highly recommend pizza shuttle in East Boston
Name: New York Pizza; Review: I ordered for delivery from New York Pizza at about 8.30 and was given a 45 minute estimate. An hour after ordering, the pizza arrived. I immediately thought something was off, as the box didn't feel warm. But, I hoped for the best and took the pizza in.  After opening the box, my initial impression was confirmed and the pizza was cold. Disappointed, I called New York Pizza to let them know that the pizza that i had just received was delivered cold.  The man who took my call, the same man who took my order, proceeded to try to convince me that the pizza was not cold because they don't deliver cold pizza. To his credit, he did offer to make me another pizza, but warned me that ""it's gonna take a while"". Having become irritated, I told him no new pizza was wanted, but that he should look into why cold pizza was being delivered.  To their credit, after warming the pizza in the microwave, it was fairly good. I image it would have been better if it didn't need to be rewarmed","Name: Boston Pizza Co; Review: I’ve been eating here since it opened. The pizza has a sweet sauce but it’s addicting and you actually crave it. It is by far the best pizza around. It also has a pool hall and bar next door where you can enjoy the food in a sports bar atmosphere! I highly recommend trying the pizza
Name: Supreme Pizza; Review: Three words. Steak & Cheese. I work in the area and this is the best place to satisfy that craving you've been having. The classic is great but so is the Steak Bomb. They fill the sub (which they will grill if you ask) to the brim with steak and sausage (you can ask for pepperoni instead to change things up) and I always add peppers, mushrooms, and onions. And don't forget the mayo, lettuce, and tomato to top it off.  If you aren't in the mood for a steak and cheese they have a number of options that you would find at most sub shops like this. I like the Italian sub and fajita wrap as well.  And if you plan on eating there try and grab one of their comfortable leather seats in the middle

Name: Rome Pizza & Grill; Review: Great pizza! I ordered a large pepperoni. The pizza was close to New York style, but a little thicker. The cheese was flavorful with lots of depth. It reminded me of Papa Gino's cheese recipe from about 2 decades ago. The tomato sauce was just tomato and seasoning. It was not too sweet. I don't like sugary tomato sauce. The crust was just a little more bread-like than I like. I would like it a little crispier. It was still really good crust and didn't get soggy. The whole pizza was so good that the overall rating was definitely 5 stars
Name: Locale; Review: I like pizza.  I have liked it for a long time, but the true meaning of pizza, I have not apprehended until just very recently, after my Boston trip.  The storefront of Locale did not strike me as especially flashy.  I really was not expecting to enjoy my food much after eating The Daily Catch, it was so good I did not think anything could come close.  There were no long lines, and the cooks were quite laid-back.  The whole atmosphere was very relaxed, contrasted from the intense surroundings of The Daily Catch.  I was about to be wowed.  First thing up: meatball.  It was pretty good; a nice, decent meatball it was.  There were a few other items of food, like bread with mozzarella and tomato, salad, etc.  They were good, but they did not wow me; but then everything changed.  The pizza came.  [The following space has been purposely left blank to generate a feeling of suspense.  Until you get that feeling, DO NOT scroll down.]  Amazing is the only word that can describe it.  Let us begin with pizza #1.  As I sank my teeth into a perfectly proportioned pizza of bread, mozzarella, and pork (I think it was bacon), all the joys I had ever experienced in my life seemed to rush into my head; and I was filled with a feeling of profound bliss.  The crust was crispy on the outside, yet al dente in the middle.  Such a crust I have never come across in my life before, mere words will not describe it.  The mozzarella did not have an overpowering taste of, well, cheese.  It was extremely flexible, and I had fun pulling on it.  The flavor of the bacon was the perfect compliment to the pizza.  It was heavenly!  The second pizza had an interesting vegetable on it.  It was not raw, it was not overcooked, but it was crisp.  Combined with fresh tomatoes, it neared perfection.  Last but not least, the mushroom pizza arrived.  The extraordinarily fresh mushroom aroma blended with the bread and cheese was wonderful.  The pizzas had specific Italian names, but I forgot them all.  If you are a pizza lover, definitely try Locale's pizza.  IT IS WORTH A TRIP TO BOSTON JUST FOR THE PIZZA!!!  If you are not a pizza lover, you must STILL try Locale's pizza.  This is my good advice for you","Name: Boston Pizza Co; Review: I’ve been eating here since it opened.

Name: Mama Rosa's Venezuela.Wings.Subs.Sazon; Review: Had large cheese pizza delivered. Was not expecting much anyway, and came in as expected. Nothing special, but good, basic pizza. Will try other menu in the next time

Name: Mangia Mangia Italian Kitchen; Review: Neopolitan atmosphere, nice cozy little place, especially on a date. I've actually only had two dishes, Pizza and Veal Parm and both were quite good. Everyone's got individual tastes when it comes to pizza, some people think Dominos is good pizza. I dunno... I grew up in Boston so I like to think I know pizza. Now, I'm not stuck you see but I am a bit of a traditionalist. But if something is good, it's good. I don't like pizza loaded with cheese or meats. Pizza is like a work of art. Crust, sauce, cheese all have to balance and mingle well. Sauce is not over tangy, just right and the crust is thin, not ""bready"". Anyway they have the best Pizza Margherita - anywhere, I swear. It's all I've got so far...sort of stuck on that. You won't be disappointed

Name: Rock City Pizza; Review: Wow. Let me tell you what. I ordered this pizza, when I was absolutely blasted on the weekend. I ordered a large pepperoni pizza, for myself. Now, I ate about 6 slices before my friends found me in the hallway absolutely destroying this pizza. The pizza was so good I had to share it. Maybe they grabbed pieces but come on, I just packed in 6 slices. I should probably share at that point. End first part of story. About 3 days later I was once again craving pizza. Stone cold sober this time around. Just craving the classic Tuesday night ZA. I first thought, wow I am gonna order from Rock City AGAIN. My friends said, no way it will be as good as it was when you were drunk. SO... I said you know, lets just see about that. I made the phone call, got her ranch dressing on the side, and boom my ZA was on its way. I opened that large pepperoni pizza up, took one bite and yep it tasted just as good. That being said, I recommend this pizza place"
Any good Thai restaurants?,"Name: Thai Place; Review: My favorite spot for truly authentic Thai food. They even have Thai menu! If you're Asian or just really well informed of what northern Thai food is all about, and also if you have a strong passion for street-style papaya salad, this is the place to go! Never gonna be disappointed They offer up to 6 different papaya salad styles; Thai, Laotian, etc. The spicy soups are to die for! Variety of Yum dishes. And the service is super good!  Down falls would be that they don't have good, or any Thai dessert. (Except sticky rice mango, which was very bland) Don't get the ice cream here
Name: Bangkok Blue; Review: I've given this place many chances and tried different things on the their menu.  What made me decide not to go back was how bad their Pad Thai is.  Because I was so hungry, I just ate the chicken & shrimps and threw away the rest.  I will not be going back there again!  There are plenty of better Thai restaurants in the area
Name: Spice & Pepper; Review: This place has the best Thai food around.  I pass three other Thai restaurants on my fifteen minute drive to get there and well worth it.  I use their green curry as a standard when out of town and none come close. Been doing their takeout for atleast 10yrs.  Give them a try
Name: Wonder Spice Cafe; Review: We went one night, and loved it so much we came back again the next night. We both got the Southern Pad Thai the first night. It was pad thai made with curry spices, and it was amazing. The second night I got the normal pad thai, it was a bit under flavored, at least in comparison to the southern pad thai, but still good
Name: Rod Thai Family Taste; Review: I love their pad thai, tom yum soup, basil fried rice, spicy crispy chicken, pad paradise, and thai iced tea. Their service is quick, food is delicious/comforting, and it's always a go-to dinner whenever I don't feel like cooking. Prior to COVID-19, I loved their outdoor seating area, and how they would always bring the food out to you if you were eating there :) I've been to other thai places in Boston and I honestly travel to go to Rod Thai because the other places just don't compare","Name: Thai Place; Review: My favorite spot for truly authentic Thai food.

Name: Thai Dish Restaurant; Review: The restaurant itself is less than impressive on the inside, and I have to say that I did not expect much when I walked in, but the food was excellent!!! for sure some of the best Thai food I have ever had. Better than many (more fancy looking) restaurants
Name: Thai Place; Review: Love this place. Good quality Thai food at very reasonable prices. It's not the most authentic Thai I've had, but the flavours are wonderful, the ""spicy"" sauces are actually spicy, and everything comes out piping hot and in generous portions. My favourite dishes are the spicy noodles and the appetizers (beef satay, mussels, butterfly shrimp, crab rangoons). The servers are efficient and friendly but don't push things (like specials) on you, unlike at a lot of American restaurants. The drinks are very affordable as well and they have a great casual bar area. My husband and I have been going to the Racha Thai restaurants for years and this is by far our favourite one
Name: Bangkok City Restaurant; Review: Awesome!  Some of the best Thai food I have ever had.  My husband and I both got Tom Yom soup and I got mine with veggies and it was just full of a huge variety of veggies that I can tell were added fresh.  Both of our dishes were great, flavorful and fresh.  Our server was pleasant, attentive and had great timing.  Our host seated us far away from other diners (which seems like a dumb detail but SO MANY other places will walk you through an empty restaurant RIGHT to the table next to someone else). The only con was my husband said to make his VERY spicy and it just wasn't spicy at all for him.  I can understand if a restaurant feels they need to be safe here, but he was asking for it.   Make him cry
Name: Thai Place; Review: Authentic Isaan food prepared in a tiny kitchen. The central Thai dishes we've tried (what you typically find in any Thai restaurant) are good, not great. The Isaan food, according to my wife, who grew up in the region, is excellent. As she lifted the first bite of noodles and som tam, before she'd actually tasted it, she said, ""delicious!"" When I asked how she knew, she answered that she could ""just tell."" She wasn't wrong. For afficionados of the strong, spicy cuisine of the Northeastern region of Thailand, this place will be a great find.

It's a family place. Both parents and two daughters are always there. They are so nice and friendly. Do not hesitate to ask. Less spice? No problem. More sweet? Sure thing. This place is known for takeout and delivery, but I do like to eat there. The place is clean and cosy. It's also green to dine in. Don't waste those plastic containers and utensils. Come and dine in at Spice & Pepper

Name: Thai Dish; Review: Love it. Small mom and pop thai place with great prices and for my money, best thai food in the area. Brown Sugar right around the corner is not only worse tasting, but more expensive.  The more I eat here, the more I am pleased. Excellent curries, soups (love it with a little sour and spice), duck fried rice and drunken noodle. Plus the mango sticky rice dessert was outstanding.  Service in the summer here has been excellent, I'm a man in need of many water refills and they provide. The best part is definitely the taste of the food

Name: Chilli Duck; Review: I love Thai food and usually find Pad Thai to be good but boring. However, I went to Chili Duck and the first time I ordered Drunken Noodles which were good but my friend had the Pad Thai and it was out of this world good. Now every time I go I get the pad thai, chicken satay, and extra peanut sauce (which is also better than almost anywhere else I've been). The place is decent sized, I've never had to wait and they are good about call in take out orders. It's definitely my new favorite Thai plac

Name: S & I To Go; Review: Food: 3 Decor: 2 Service: 3  Came here to grab some dinner to go.  1. SL5 Som Tum (Papaya Salad) * * Thai spicy salad in lime juice with fresh papaya strips and hot chili, minced dry shrimp, tomatoes and peanuts served with sticky rice. 8.5 ~Pretty good, although we couldn't eat more than a couple bites since the medium spiciness was incredibly hot.  2. H1 Crispy Chicken Basil * * Crispy chicken sauteed tender meat with fresh minced hot peppers, fresh basil leaves, mushrooms and onions ~Pretty good. Chicken was fried nicely, and it had a good amount of heat.  3. Thai Ice Tea 1.75 ~Okay.  4. N1 Pad Si Ew Pan fried wide rice noodle with chicken, beef or pork, Chinese broccoli, egg and white pepper in brown sauce. 7.5 ~Okay. Ended up eating most of this since everything else was so spicy.  Service was pretty good, and the food was fast

Name: Beantown Pho & Grill; Review: I have been here twice, but maybe I will drop by there again.  Located both downstairs and on a terrace, this restaurant offers both Thai and Vietnamese food. I sat on both down inside and outside sitting, and in both places service was good and fast. Downstairs the rest  Thai iced tea is a perfect option for summer as it's very refreshing and good. They have spicy food, so take a look into the menu and look for the spicy dishes. The menu has both lunch and dinner pricing, so if you want to save some bucks you should come on lunch time.  I tried Tom Yum Pad Thai and chicken Panang Curry, both were awesome, tasty and spicy. Also the crunchy rolls and the banana dessert were really good and worth to try. The staff is really paying attention to every customer, refilling their glasses or asking if something is missing or wrong.  I haven't tried Pho dishes, so maybe next time I will give them a try"
Show me Indian cuisine options,"Name: Punjab Palace; Review: While i was hunting for an good indian restaurant with true indian flavour and spices in boston area. I found this restaurant on brighton ave and just  came to try it once. It was on friday evening crowded with many people. I had recieved a great welcome from this guys. I ordered  palak paneer with some garlic bread and it was served with great taste. Mango lassi was really awesome. These guys also do home delivery and they are very sure about 40 min delivery time. It was like another good news for me, where i can get food from the best restaurant within 40 minutes. I would like to rate this restaurant as top indian retaurant where i could not found this taste in the other retaurants which i visited near this area. My friends from different countries like indian food and they all keep asking me the best indian restaurant, so now i can proudly suggest this restaurant for best indian tasty food. Thanks for the management and staff for serving the best indian food
Name: Halal Indian Cuisine; Review: Where do I begin with this place. From the horrible quality food to the unfriendly staff who overcharged me on two separate occasions for a side item that was supposed to be included in the meal per the menu. Calling the food comparable to frozen Indian food would be disrespectful frozen Indian food from the grocery store. This is the worst tasting Indian food I have ever tried. If your that desperate for Indian food and live in the Brigham Circle area there are plenty of Indian restaurants with take out that deliver to this area with higher quality food FYI
Name: Tandoori Grill; Review: The food was AMAZING and the service was great! Definitely one of the best Indian buffets outside of Boston. The food was cooked perfectly, the bread was extremely fresh, and the owner offered whatever specialty I was craving made to order. I would recommend this to anyone who likes REAL AUTHENTIC HIGH QUALITY INDIAN FOOD. I have eaten at every Indian restaurant in the area and this is by far my favorite. 5 stars!!
Name: Dosa Factory; Review: Stay away from this place. Service is garbage. Food is garbage. Homeless people come off the street and use their bathroom and lock themselves in for an hour so you can't even use the bathroom. The food quality is no where near Indian. Very bland and no taste. As an Indian I have some expectation of Indian taste but this was nothing like India and their slogan is ""Indian street food."" We got our bill and no compensation or anything. NOT EVEN AN APOLOGY. PAID $158.69 and no satisfaction. You would think being on newbury street in Boston this place would have their head on straight but the non Indian clients don't know the difference and that must be their main business. STAY AWAY. I'D RATHER PAY 5 TIMES THE MONEY AND GO TO THE SKETCHIEST PLACE IN BOSTON TO EAT KNOWING SERVICE AND FOOD WOULD BE BETTER. I wouldn't even tell my worst enemy to eat here
Name: Tantric India Bistro; Review: The food here is not bad, but Tantric makes claims that it falls incredibly short of. First off, there is nothing special about the food, nor is it particularly ""regional"" as the place claims, with the exception of some dosa items. A review in a frame on the front of the restaurant lauds it for offering an alternative to the ""over sauced"" mediocre Indian food in America. Ironically, the food is awash in sauces which taste straight out of a jar (the day-glo orange tint of the malai kofta and chicken vindaloo gravies, which taste exactly alike, doesn't help.) If your guests are not into Indian food, this place will probably be fine, if a bit overpriced. But if you have some background in Indian cuisine styles or live amongst an Indian community, you are probably better off going to your local sit-down joint","Name: Tantric India Bistro; Review: Today I went for lunch buffet, the food was not made for Indian customers. It lack taste and the options to choose were few(not more than 5-6 items). So on weekend they serve Bhel puri(Indian snack) for lunch buffet, but what I observed was not a Bhel puri to my eyes, wish I could have taken screenshot and attach here. Now I know, why there was few people on weekend during lunch hours. Wish they could make real India food
Name: D'tandoor; Review: Had butter chicken. Still can't find one like my dads. They use a lot of tomato sauce rather using heavy cream or sour cream. Very little butter used. First thing is color, butter chicken is light orange. This was dark red and I got medium spice. The biriyani also had too much anise star seasoning. I had one bite and that's all I could taste. I also asked for boneless and they gave me with bone and not much meat. Indian people: just ask your parents or grandparents to make you food. I've been to over 30 Indian restaurants in Mass and they all don't have good curry. Like its not that hard. White people won't complain because they don't know much in the same way Indians don't know if Italian food is good outside. Save your money, eat at home or your aunties
Name: Gourmet India; Review: I went here because the menu listed several lamb entree options. There's only ""vegetarian or chicken?"" (<= exactly what the guy said, actually...) So that was disappointing. Also, the prices are higher than listed here: huge nono. If I am going to pay $10.50 for a vegetarian entree without a drink, nan, samosas, etc... I better know that before I make the trip over
Name: Tikkaway Grill; Review: Fast casual Indian with fresh, flavorful ingredients. Brightly lit interior, colorful and cheerful decor, extremely clean, environmentally conscious (compostable containers, and they encourage recycling). Seating is a little limited. We stopped by for a quick dinner and ordered a classic rice bowl minus onions, a roti wrap with chicken and aloo (potato), and a salad bowl with chicken and chana (chickpeas). The masala sauce for the classic rice bowl was very mildly spicy but tolerable for our two children (3 and 6 years of age), and they ate most of the the base ingredients, also a little rice. We loaded up most of the available choices for the wrap and salad bowl (vindaloo sauce, no red onions), which were both delicious. The green chili peppers were quite spicy (more than the vindaloo sauce), which we appreciated. Mango lassi was delicious, not overly sweet. Mint chutney was flavorful and thinner than some other places, mango chutney was actually a little similar to tamarind sauce. Portions were extremely generous, likely could make two lunch meals out of one order unless you have the opportunity to take a little nap afterwards. Staff and owner were friendly and extremely gracious, even after a mishap on the part of our son (the younger one). Don't forget to squeeze the horn by the door (""horn please"")
Name: Gourmet India; Review: The service was very fast and friendly, and I thought the prices were fine considering the location and the amount of food you get. It's great to have an Indian option in Faneuil Hall, and u was looking forward to trying it. Unfortunately I thought the food was very bland and watery. I got a combo plate with chicken vindaloo and saag paneer and both were disappointing and really missing the flavor I was hoping for. The vindaloo, though they warned me it was spicy, was not spicy at all to me.  I didn't try the naan but it didn't look tempting from what I could see.  A bit disappointing overall","Name: Tantric India Bistro; Review: Today I went for lunch buffet, the food was not made for Indian customers. It lack taste and the options to choose were few(not more than 5-6 items). So on weekend they serve Bhel puri(Indian snack) for lunch buffet, but what I observed was not a Bhel puri to my eyes, wish I could have taken screenshot and attach here. Now I know, why there was few people on weekend during lunch hours. Wish they could make real India food

Name: D'tandoor; Review: Had butter chicken. Still can't find one like my dads. They use a lot of tomato sauce rather using heavy cream or sour cream. Very little butter used. First thing is color, butter chicken is light orange. This was dark red and I got medium spice. The biriyani also had too much anise star seasoning. I had one bite and that's all I could taste. I also asked for boneless and they gave me with bone and not much meat. Indian people: just ask your parents or grandparents to make you food. I've been to over 30 Indian restaurants in Mass and they all don't have good curry. Like its not that hard. White people won't complain because they don't know much in the same way Indians don't know if Italian food is good outside. Save your money, eat at home or your aunties

Name: Gourmet India; Review: I went here because the menu listed several lamb entree options. There's only ""vegetarian or chicken?"" (<= exactly what the guy said, actually...) So that was disappointing. Also, the prices are higher than listed here: huge nono. If I am going to pay $10.50 for a vegetarian entree without a drink, nan, samosas, etc... I better know that before I make the trip over

Name: Tikkaway Grill; Review: Fast casual Indian with fresh, flavorful ingredients. Brightly lit interior, colorful and cheerful decor, extremely clean, environmentally conscious (compostable containers, and they encourage recycling). Seating is a little limited. We stopped by for a quick dinner and ordered a classic rice bowl minus onions, a roti wrap with chicken and aloo (potato), and a salad bowl with chicken and chana (chickpeas). The masala sauce for the classic rice bowl was very mildly spicy but tolerable for our two children (3 and 6 years of age), and they ate most of the the base ingredients, also a little rice. We loaded up most of the available choices for the wrap and salad bowl (vindaloo sauce, no red onions), which were both delicious. The green chili peppers were quite spicy (more than the vindaloo sauce), which we appreciated. Mango lassi was delicious, not overly sweet. Mint chutney was flavorful and thinner than some other places, mango chutney was actually a little similar to tamarind sauce.

My friends described IndianStyle food as ""home cooked food"", but honestly, it's worse; I don't know how it has almost 5 stars rating.. Waste of money.  Edit: I got roti and dal makhani. Roti was below average. It could be because it was a takeout or possibly the ingredients aren't good quality. As for Dal Makhani, it was watery and loaded with chili pepper. I don't mind spicy food, but it is supposed to be in balanced with other spices. In this sabzi, I couldn't taste any salt, garlic, tomatoes, ghee, butter and other ingredients. I was surprisingly disappointed considering this is a famous Panjabi dish. I honestly had to spit out the food. It was that bad. I didn't even bother tasting Veg. Chicken Korma after eating Dal Makhani. I usually don't write reviews unless a restaurant is really good or really bad. Knowing this is a small family owned restaurant, I feel bad putting this review

Name: JMP Fine Indian Cuisine; Review: The very best Indian food in Boston. I have had the biriyani from here and every single time, it's been delectable! The spice, the rice and the meat is on point. No Peas in the rice, as some supposed Indian restaurants have presented it with. The quantity is quite satisfactory too!  I've had a samosa chaat as well, which was surprisingly good. Oh, the cherry on top? They get Indo-Chinese dishes(which is a VERY different thing from authentic Chinese) exactly right

Name: Darbar; Review: Rather mixed experience. One of the few places in the area to get decent goat. But some things were so bad not to warrant a return. Darbar has a long menu, serving what most people identify as Indian food. But some specialties are distinctly Pakistani & some items resemble Persian rather than Indian food. The latter includes breads. Naan & parathas are more leavened than you see in Indian cuisine. If you expect an Indian specialty you'll be disappointed. Most dishes seem competent although execution details can be improved. But buffet service was a miserable experience. There were 6 dishes - 1 rice, 3 vegetarian (turnip, chick peas, cauliflower&broccoli ?!), 1 chicken & one nondescript substance that turned out to be haleem. Chicken ""quorma"" would've been fine if steadily refilled. But for over 1h, it was all curry, no chicken. Biriyani had no meat, was heavily colored (red), very spicy and exhibited large chunks of undercooked potato. Both chicken & chick peas took forever to refill. Sliced turnip dish might've been the best of the bunch. Broccoli just isn't Indian/Pakistani & this curry made it obvious. Haleem resembled what one finds in a loaded diaper - flavors are good but it's hard to get past texture & appearance. The best part in it was what appeared to be barley, although no staff could figure out what the grain was - the overwhelmed waiter said it was ground beef & 3 kinds of lentils. Uhm... no. Kheer lacked starchy viscosity, resembling thin soup - but the flavor was spot on. Second order of naan came looking like it was run over by a tractor. Onion chutney looked like it was soaked in Red #1 (remember that massive recall a few years ago?) The delays in buffet refill were explained later. Turns out kitchen was short staffed & they got a large catering order for a funeral. To make things worse, when we asked for tandoori chicken, the wait would've been 25 min. Glad to know they cook it to order but that's just ridiculous. Instead of closing the buffet for 1 day they just screwed the customers. Weekend buffet is better but would anyone want to run the risk of another funeral interfering with their dinner? Too bad. Goat dishes are competent to very good, curries have good flavors even when texture is a bit off. But biriyani & haleem are unacceptable. And service kills the whole experienc

Name: Tandoori Grill; Review: The food was AMAZING and the service was great! Definitely one of the best Indian buffets outside of Boston. The food was cooked perfectly, the bread was extremely fresh, and the owner offered whatever specialty I was craving made to order. I would recommend this to anyone who likes REAL AUTHENTIC HIGH QUALITY INDIAN FOOD. I have eaten at every Indian restaurant in the area and this is by far my favorite. 5 stars!!

Name: Tantric India Bistro; Review: The food here is not bad, but Tantric makes claims that it falls incredibly short of. First off, there is nothing special about the food, nor is it particularly ""regional"" as the place claims, with the exception of some dosa items. A review in a frame on the front of the restaurant lauds it for offering an alternative to the ""over sauced"" mediocre Indian food in America. Ironically, the food is awash in sauces which taste straight out of a jar (the day-glo orange tint of the malai kofta and chicken vindaloo gravies, which taste exactly alike, doesn't help.) If your guests are not into Indian food, this place will probably be fine, if a bit overpriced. But if you have some background in Indian cuisine styles or live amongst an Indian community, you are probably better off going to your local sit-down joint"
BBQ places in the area,"Name: The Smoke Shop BBQ - Seaport; Review: Great restaurant in multiple regards. The BBQ itself is flavorful and good. It's hard to find good BBQ in Boston, and while I'm sure this isn't the same as the pit bosses make in the south, it definitely holds its own! I like the way they do their flavors. I know there are many styles but I prefer mine more smokey with a spice kick and a hint of sweet. I don't care as much for the very sweet BBQ sauces. They do their BBQ the way I like it, with just the right amount of a little kick that wont knock you over, so don't worry if you don't like spicy. I got the burned ends dish and it was very flavorful. It comes with a choice of 2 sides. The mac n cheese could've been creamier but that's my one little ""complaint"" as far as food quality goes. I don't know much about whiskey, but if you like whiskey they have a lot to choose from. The dishes are expensive for what you get, which is to be expected of BBQ but the portions were a bit on the small side, but still satisfying. The staff was GREAT. They did what they could to get a table ready for me and my wife. I never felt rushed with the order even though they were busy and the waiter answered all my questions and was polite. They even gave us a free cocktail that they accidentally made for someone else! Parking is difficult and not recommended but if money isn't an issue you'll find garages. The easiest way to get here is to take the T to South Station, walk over the bridge to the seaport district and head north one block to Congress street. Only about 1/2 mile walk. I recommend the Smoke Shop BBQ
Name: Cornerstone Pizza Cafe; Review: The wings are amazing... We had the Lemon pepper, honey BBQ and BBQ. Highly recommend! The prices are excellent too. We found our new Friday night treat to ourselves. Recap: Friendly service Great prices Delicious wings. Order often
Name: Sate Grill-on-Wheels; Review: Best Asian Food Truck!  I love their noodle soups, their Korean BBQ Tofu (I think the meat lovers in the office also love the carnivore BBQ), their salads dishes and their daily specials. Great price value and service, convenient location
Name: L&C Spanish Restaurant; Review: Tried a lot of places in the Boston area and this is one of the best. exceptional food and service. Would recommend L&C to anyone looking for delicious Spanish take-out
Name: BOSTON KABOB COMPANY; Review: The food in this place is the best mediterranean food I had in Boston area, and is better than many places in Israel","Name: Great Barbecue; Review: This restaurant is certainly one of the coolest restaurants in the neighborhood. Whenever I visit this place I am profoundly pleased. They manage their high  level service and the highest level of food  they offer. You surely will enjoy this this place. Very  recommended

Name: Best Bar B Que Restaurant; Review: Operating smart and safe during Covid,  one in, one out for take out service.  No dine in area. Roast pork $15/lb. So good though!  Nice people too
Name: Tasty BBQ; Review: This place definitely exceeded my expectations. Being a hole in the wall restaurant in a food court, I didn’t think the food would be that good, but I was wrong! The ribs were great and the staff was even friendlier. I came to this place since the first restaurant I was getting takeout at was closed, would definitely go back again the next time I visit Boston
Name: Quic Pic BBQ; Review: Large portions of delicious food at a very reasonable price! There are a ton of different options on the menu, and the meat is always juicy and flavorful. I usually get the 3-meat combo with Peking duck, scallion chicken, and crispy pork. The vegetable side changes from day to day, but is usually either cabbage or broccoli (also yummy). If you eat in, a bowl of soup is also provided. There is often a line, but it moves very quickly, so if you're hoping to get take-out you can get your food easily in 5-10 minutes maximum. As the shop name suggests though, this place is decidedly not for vegetarians. Would highly recommend dropping by for some of the best (in my opinion) Chinese BBQ in town","Name: Quic Pic BBQ; Review: Large portions of delicious food at a very reasonable price!

Name: The Smoke Shop BBQ - Seaport; Review: Edit: We've since been back a few times and I'm adding another star.  The service remains to be some of the best in the city.  I actually think the bbq has gotten better since opening.  We've tried most things on the menu at this point save a few appetizers.  The wings remain amazing, the pulled pork is done just right. The ribs have been perfected.  The burnt ends have amazing flavor.  The pulled chicken is wonderful. This batch of corn bread was perfect.  The beans are still a little too heavy on the vinegar for my taste but my wife loves them. Collard greens have full and developed flavor and are rich and sweet.  Original: I'm changing my review after a third visit.  I'd rate this 3 stars over all for bbq but service is really good.  Mac and cheese fritters are amazing,  wings are perfect sweet and smokey,  ribs are well done.  Brisket is wonderful.  Pulled pork is spicy but done well. My complaint is small.  There is an over use of vinegar in a lot of dishes.  The pit beans are more vinegar based rather than bbq, the Texas toast for some reason has a very unpleasant mustard flavor,  corn bread while tasty and I love the honey butter topped bit is very dry. The flavor profiles don't mix well for some reason.   Still one of the best bbq joints in Boston but compared to the rest of the country only in the middle at best

Name: Sweet Cheeks Q; Review: I hadn't had BBQ in quite some time.  So when offered, I couldn't turn it down.  We ordered short ribs, which were very long, pork ribs, fried chicken and Brisket.  It was a 45min wait so we decided to get it to go.  Wait time wasn't very lengthy.  Hostess was a consummate pro.  We were bummed that they only gave us one tray of bbq sauce.  Seemed small for a big order.  With only a couple of sides, order came just a bit over 100$.  Not too bad for four, but that's without drinks.  The drive home wasn't long so the food was still warm.  Beef ribs were delicious, with the meat quite literally falling off the bone.  A good balance between meat and fat.  And good enough for two, if you're not starved.  The fried chicken was ok, not great.  It was undercooked in the inside.   The spare ribs were good, not amazing though.  One thing I felt whilst eating the ribs was that, although they were good, it didn't feel as though they had been cooked from scratch.  They were too clean and nicely done, if that makes sense.  It had a feel that it was some sort of prepackaged meat that had been heated up, but in a very good way.  For me a dinner place has to have food that was raw before it was cooked.  That's why I never like places like TGI or Applebees and the like.  These ribs had a vibe of those places.   They tasted good enough, don't get mewrong, but just not of the quality of the beef ribs.  Once place overall.  An open area feel to it and lots of people in big groups eating.  Parking was not a problem but it was also a tepidly quiet Saturday evening

Name: Larry J's BBQ Cafe; Review: Went to the Revere spot yesterday. Got 2 plates and 2 apps. Terrible food. Spent 80 bucks the food was super dry. I know a good bbq when i see one. Brisket being most important it was slices super thin like a pork loin no fat or bbq sauce on it. If you want to try REAL BBQ ITS A DISTANCE GO TO GOODIE COLES IN EPPING N.H. BEST IN THE BUSINESS. I asked the cook if he slices his brisket he said proudly thats the only way. It def wasnt brisket. I think i might even get him a plate from Goodies. My ribs were better baked the night before then his dry ribs. The greens we eatable but im sure they werent fresh. And the mac had no cheese just bread crumbs. He needs a smoker for bbqin. No b.

Name: Little Caesars Pizza; Review: I normally enjoy little Caesar's but third location is terrible.  The pizza was extra thin and over cooked.  I asked for barbeque wings and when they messed up the order and made hot wings they decided our egos be a good idea to just throw a little barbeque on top of it instead of replacing the wings.  The marinara sauce was extremely runny and flavorless.  I don't ever remember being this dissatisfied with little Cesar's.  But I will never return to Boston rd location

Name: Real Deal, LLC; Review: Covid helpful info: parallel street parking, no meters. Most times of the day you can find a spot near this location. Once you walk into the joint you will go to the cashier to get your food. They have 2-3 tables inside but not sure if you can dine in there. No tables to dine out, it is mostly a location people do take out or delivery from.  This location is a local favorite for me. I used to live near the Cleveland Circle location, hang out with friends near the JP one, and now I live by the West Roxbury location and I love them all equally. Their food is consistent and they are always quick. My favorite app that I get almost every time is their onion rings because they are really yummy but I am a big fan of sauces and their kickin bayou sauce is delicious! The sauce is like a sriracha, Mayo, and other yummy things (real deal sorry if I’m wrong with those ingredients!) Meals I typically get are the Joe Spa (chicken Caesar wrap), Reuben, grown up grilled cheese, any burger, and any pizza. Definitely would recommend going to any of their locations"
Best burger joints nearby,"Name: Cobblestone Café; Review: I thought this restaurant isn't everything people are screaming about,  the medium burger my son ordered was rare and he asked for no tomatoes. He said the flavor was good but only ate half the burger. (Because it was rare) if you claim to be the best burger in town (which most of boston does) than be the best burger in town! That means from the beginning to the end, get the order right, cook it right, and serve it right. My husband ordered a well cooked burger and it was pink! Good job guys. So not impressed and will not return nor will recommend
Name: 5 Napkin Burger; Review: Disappointed all around.  The best part of the ""burger"" was the bun and the toppings.  I ordered online to pick up. The website told me estimated pick up time -  30 minutes.  I got there 30 minutes later to a near empty restaurant. Don't know what would take 30 minutes to make my fairly simple order of Bacon Cheddar Burger and cheese tots.  Well the order must have not taken 30 minutes and was sitting on the bar there for me when I got in there,and 2 minutes later when I got to my hotel room, the burger and the cheese tots were cold.  Burger was warm, the tots were legitimately COLD.  Other reviews say how huge the burgers are.  Mine was not so big.  It is not one of those big fat juicy burgers that is round and dripping with juice.  It was one of those flat thin burgers that reminded me of those frozen pre made burgers that were served from the food service, thrown on the grill frozen and just cooked from there.  The website allows you to choose your burger either medium or well-done.  I put in the notes on my order medium rare.  The burger was not hardly cooked.  It wasn't medium rare.  It was basically seared on both sides of the thin wimpy burger and then raw on the middle. The meat quality was poor since it was raw, I had to pick out all sorts of grisle and uncooked meat.  Then the Bacon Cheddar burger further disappointed.   There was no bacon on the burger. I think the cook was perhaps confounded by the infrequent ""medium-rare"" request and forgot about topping the Bacon Cheddar burger with bacon. To my dismay, the cold tots, numbered only 11 in a paper container that looked not so different from a fast food restaurant. With the paltry serving size, the cold 11 tots looked pathetic in the large container. The sesame brioche and toppings on the burger were satisfactory.  The raw white onion on top was nice flavor and mild, and sliced nice and thin.  The butter lettuce seemed fresh and clean.  The cheese was melted  and the bun toasted.  But boil it all down and you have a burger that is 3x the price of a fast food burger, that is not even as good as a fast food burger, and all for what?  Cause there is a burger fad that these guys had a vision to create the perfect burger?  I can see what they had envisioned, and perhaps another location of theirs has it mastered, but the location in Back Bay, Boston missed by a long shot.  Save your extra $10 and get a better fast food burger at any of the crappy little chains
Name: UBURGER; Review: This place was awesome before hamburger joints became trendy.  Great quality ingredients and just SO delicious.  The frappes are also the best.  I can only ever do 2 of the 3 though: fries, frappe, burger.  Never all 3 or I'd never be able to walk again.  I think the Big Pappi Burger is the way to go.  Its always packed, especially during games, and not the fastest place, but so very worth it.  Great deal too, definitely leave full for under $10.  Also you have to love a place that does water cups so you can wash it all down without having to buy a drink.  Their expansion to new locations is just the icing on the cake, now the rest of the city can try some delicious Uburger too
Name: Mangia Mangia North End; Review: Might be Boston's best keep secret, it should be rated as Boston's best burger. The subs looked amazing, I had a burger. It was the first restaurant I been to,in 6-7 months. I couldn't have picked a better place. Highlight or my Boston trip..  Thank you again
Name: Punto Rojo; Review: The best Colombian restaurant I have been in this country !! I live in NY and I came to visit Boston and this place really made me happy with its food and good service, the price for the quality and quantity of food is more than perfect !! I looked at many Reviews of restaurants nearby and this was the best and the best choice! All very tasty!","Name: Tasty Burger; Review: I maintain that there are basically two burger places in downtown Boston. One is the Boston Burger Company, which is known for their absurdly expensive and quite frankly ridiculous burgers (which I'm not knocking, it's just - have you ever actually TRIED to eat their 420 Burger?) The other is Tasty Burger, which is a significantly more sane and down-to-earth diner environs in which you can enjoy a normal burger.  It's basically a bar, really, and it minces no words about it. You go there to get a big cold beer, eat a (really tasty) Big Tasty burger with a side of absurdly greasy onion rings, and finish it off with a tiny pie. Who cares, it's a good burger joint, it doesn't try to be anything else. It's also one of the only places around here that actually serves Cheerwine. You remember Cheerwine? Where else can I get it around here? Who supplies these people? These are the everyday mysteries that vex me.  Their chicken parm sandwich ""suffers"" from an INCREDIBLE amount of cheese stretch, which did mildly incapacitate my girlfriend when I took her there. It's a bit of a choking hazard if you're unprepared. Just a word of warning.  The food is reasonably priced for the portions, and I guarantee you won't walk away hungry. The tables have a wide variety of different sauces and stuff, like a big basket thing full of pretty much all the condiments, including the ones that don't make any sense to use on any of their menu items. The fry spice blend is quite good. Don't overdo it, though, it can get overpowering.  They also sell merch, like some kind of weird clothing brand. I don't get who it's marketed towards (the Cracker Barrel business model does NOT work in cities,) but I have to admit that a knockoff Supreme box logo shirt that says ""Big Tasty"" on it is a hilarious novelty.  You can buy a whole sack of hamburgers for like 30 dollars, give or take. That's insane. Review over
Name: Boston Burger Company; Review: Hands Down Best Burger Period!  We had no idea this place existed until we did a google search for good burgers near Harvard Square! It was a Monday evening when we walked less than half a mile away from Harvard Square to this little industrial looking restaurant. We were greeted and sat down quickly. Our waiter was very nice and was quick to answer any questions we had. The menus have tons of options for different fry appetizers and different burgers! We started out with a few drinks and the Pepperoni pizza fries as an appetizer. The fries were a very decent size and easily split between two people. They were a little greasy, but delicious! For main entrees, I got the Buffalo burger and my fiancee got the Killer Bee Burger. My burger was all I could have asked for; a medium cooked burger with buffalo flavoring and bleu cheese dripping down the sides. One yummy mess! My fiancee's burger was topped with onion rings covered in BBQ sauce. Both burgers came with sides of either coleslaw or baked beans and their house-made potato chips. It was a little pricey, but we did go all out with alcoholic drinks, an appetizer AND the burgers. We were stuffed to the brim with food, so if you're on a diet this is the last place you ever want to visit. However, if you are looking to live life to the fullest and enjoy absolutely delicious burgers served with great customer service, you are in the right place!

Name: Boston Burger Co-Davis Sq; Review: The burgers are amazing!  The burger patty itself is quality!  Then you have all these fun combinations. Some more suite my taste while others are more for a college student coming off a bender.  I had Green Monster with Mac & Cheese (grilled) my wife made her own.  We also had the nacho fries.  No doggie bag for me  The Green Monster and the nacho fries had really good pico de gallo. There only a few places in MA with good pico de gallo, this is one of them.  The menu is straight forward; however, they allow for substitutions and cusotmer.  Lots of table turn over, but there is no rush... Yes they have outdoor seating.  Convenient location Its is right across the street form the Davis Sq T station.  There is street parking
Name: Beta Burger; Review: Really good burgers. They really talk up the sous vide thing, and I wish I could tell the difference, but it would seem that it should be a bit healthier. Staff are really nice and it seems to be locally run. There's a nice lady there who I think is the owner and always looks for genuine feedback. Better than most fast food
Name: UBURGER; Review: A+ across the board! We have been going to uBurger since they opened their first location in Kenmore 5 years ago. We have known the owner Nick since the day they opened. He is as solid as they come, and their burgers are incredible! I actually mixed it up last night and went with their garden salad with grilled chicken, at their Commonwealth Ave. location, and it was also phenomenal.  They make their salads fresh twice daily, so the lettuce was outstanding, veggies fresh, and the grilled chicken was mouth watering.  And I am very picky with salads. You can't go wrong here.  I prefer the Yuppy Burger with swiss cheese, mushrooms and bacon, and I order an extra patty for a $1.  No-brainer! :) As we were walking out the owner Nick offered us free milkshakes to thank us for being such loyal customers.  Just a great great guy. I have literally stopped going to restaurants based on an owner being cold. Nick should write a book on how to treat customers. Support this local business! They are the best burgers in town, and just a great group of employees, who help make our overall experience an A+ every time we walk through the doors.

The other is Tasty Burger, which is a significantly more sane and down-to-earth diner environs in which you can enjoy a normal burger.  It's basically a bar, really, and it minces no words about it. You go there to get a big cold beer, eat a (really tasty) Big Tasty burger with a side of absurdly greasy onion rings, and finish it off with a tiny pie. Who cares, it's a good burger joint, it doesn't try to be anything else. It's also one of the only places around here that actually serves Cheerwine. You remember Cheerwine? Where else can I get it around here? Who supplies these people? These are the everyday mysteries that vex me.  Their chicken parm sandwich ""suffers"" from an INCREDIBLE amount of cheese stretch, which did mildly incapacitate my girlfriend when I took her there. It's a bit of a choking hazard if you're unprepared. Just a word of warning.  The food is reasonably priced for the portions, and I guarantee you won't walk away hungry. The tables have a wide variety of different sauces and stuff, like a big basket thing full of pretty much all the condiments, including the ones that don't make any sense to use on any of their menu items. The fry spice blend is quite good. Don't overdo it, though, it can get overpowering.  They also sell merch, like some kind of weird clothing brand. I don't get who it's marketed towards (the Cracker Barrel business model does NOT work in cities,) but I have to admit that a knockoff Supreme box logo shirt that says ""Big Tasty"" on it is a hilarious novelty.  You can buy a whole sack of hamburgers for like 30 dollars, give or take. That's insane. Review over

Name: Boston Burger Company; Review: Hands Down Best Burger Period!  We had no idea this place existed until we did a google search for good burgers near Harvard Square! It was a Monday evening when we walked less than half a mile away from Harvard Square to this little industrial looking restaurant. We were greeted and sat down quickly. Our waiter was very nice and was quick to answer any questions we had. The menus have tons of options for different fry appetizers and different burgers! We started out with a few drinks and the Pepperoni pizza fries as an appetizer. The fries were a very decent size and easily split between two people. They were a little greasy, but delicious! For main entrees, I got the Buffalo burger and my fiancee got the Killer Bee Burger. My burger was all I could have asked for; a medium cooked burger with buffalo flavoring and bleu cheese dripping down the sides. One yummy mess! My fiancee's burger was topped with onion rings covered in BBQ sauce. Both burgers came with sides of either coleslaw or baked beans and their house-made potato chips. It was a little pricey, but we did go all out with alcoholic drinks, an appetizer AND the burgers. We were stuffed to the brim with food, so if you're on a diet this is the last place you ever want to visit. However, if you are looking to live life to the fullest and enjoy absolutely delicious burgers served with great customer service, you are in the right place!

Name: Boston Burger Co-Davis Sq; Review: The burgers are amazing!  The burger patty itself is quality!  Then you have all these fun combinations. Some more suite my taste while others are more for a college student coming off a bender.  I had Green Monster with Mac & Cheese (grilled) my wife made her own.  We also had the nacho fries.  No doggie bag for me  The Green Monster and the nacho fries had really good pico de gallo. There only a few places in MA with good pico de gallo, this is one of them.  The menu is straight forward; however, they allow for substitutions and cusotmer.  Lots of table turn over, but there is no rush... Yes they have outdoor seating.  Convenient location Its is right across the street form the Davis Sq T station.  There is street parking

Name: UBURGER; Review: A+ across the board! We have been going to uBurger since they opened their first location in Kenmore 5 years ago. We have known the owner Nick since the day they opened. He is as solid as they come, and their burgers are incredible! I actually mixed it up last night and went with their garden salad with grilled chicken, at their Commonwealth Ave. location, and it was also phenomenal.  They make their salads fresh twice daily, so the lettuce was outstanding, veggies fresh, and the grilled chicken was mouth watering.  And I am very picky with salads. You can't go wrong here.  I prefer the Yuppy Burger with swiss cheese, mushrooms and bacon, and I order an extra patty for a $1.  No-brainer! :) As we were walking out the owner Nick offered us free milkshakes to thank us for being such loyal customers.  Just a great great guy. I have literally stopped going to restaurants based on an owner being cold. Nick should write a book on how to treat customers. Support this local business! They are the best burgers in town, and just a great group of employees, who help make our overall experience an A+ every time we walk through the doors. Thank you, uBurger

Name: 5 Napkin Burger; Review: Disappointed all around.  The best part of the ""burger"" was the bun and the toppings.  I ordered online to pick up. The website told me estimated pick up time -  30 minutes.  I got there 30 minutes later to a near empty restaurant. Don't know what would take 30 minutes to make my fairly simple order of Bacon Cheddar Burger and cheese tots.  Well the order must have not taken 30 minutes and was sitting on the bar there for me when I got in there,and 2 minutes later when I got to my hotel room, the burger and the cheese tots were cold.  Burger was warm, the tots were legitimately COLD.  Other reviews say how huge the burgers are.  Mine was not so big.  It is not one of those big fat juicy burgers that is round and dripping with juice.  It was one of those flat thin burgers that reminded me of those frozen pre made burgers that were served from the food service, thrown on the grill frozen and just cooked from there.  The website allows you to choose your burger either medium or well-done.  I put in the notes on my order medium rare.  The burger was not hardly cooked.  It wasn't medium rare.  It was basically seared on both sides of the thin wimpy burger and then raw on the middle. The meat quality was poor since it was raw, I had to pick out all sorts of grisle and uncooked meat.  Then the Bacon Cheddar burger further disappointed.   There was no bacon on the burger. I think the cook was perhaps confounded by the infrequent ""medium-rare"" request and forgot about topping the Bacon Cheddar burger with bacon. To my dismay, the cold tots, numbered only 11 in a paper container that looked not so different from a fast food restaurant. With the paltry serving size, the cold 11 tots looked pathetic in the large container. The sesame brioche and toppings on the burger were satisfactory.  The raw white onion on top was nice flavor and mild, and sliced nice and thin.  The butter lettuce seemed fresh and clean.  The cheese was melted  and the bun toasted.  But boil it all down and you have a burger that is 3x the price of a fast food burger, that is not even as good as a fast food burger, and all for what?  Cause there is a burger fad that these guys had a vision to create the perfect burger?  I can see what they had envisioned, and perhaps another location of theirs has it mastered, but the location in Back Bay, Boston missed by a long shot.  Save your extra $10 and get a better fast food burger at any of the crappy little chains","Name: The Capital Burger; Review: Recently went to this restaurant on Newbury Street and I have to say the burger was one of the best I’ve ever had. I’m not in Boston very often, but when I’m in town, this is going to be my spot. Not often you find this type of easy going atmosphere at an upscale burger restaurant. Highly recommend if you’re down on Newbury Street or in town for Fenway

Name: Crazy Good Kitchen (C.G.K ON NEWBURY); Review: Amazing burgers but mediocre chicken tenders. Recently dropped by to get chicken tenders, chili burger, and the double double trouble burger. Their patties, despite being cooked medium well done, were full of beefy flavors and it was truly one of the best I've tried in Boston. I opted for the double patty and it was difficult to bite through without getting messy, but it was absolutely worth it. Their chicken tenders, however, were more like dry rotisserie chicken. Pickles on the side definitely helped, but it wasn't exactly what I expected. Highly recommend trying their burgers though

Name: Smashburger; Review: Ate here for the first time. Had the single Smashburger and sweet potato fries. It was standard. I’d try something else

Name: Noble Roman's Pizza; Review: They make the best specially breaded french fries and onion rings ever. Their hamburgers are also delicious. And they have very friendly customer service...thank you

Name: Wahlburgers; Review: Burgers off the beaten path but worth it. Wahlburgers has been expanding its chain and for those who don't go into the Back Bay/Landmark Building area of Boston or Logan airport in Terminal C prob with a ticket to get to that section of the airport, Wahlburgers opened a restaurant in South Bay Shopping Center in Dorchester. The Wahlburgs being from Dorchester, it makes sense to have a ""home"" location. The restaurant is not located on the main strip which is a drag for those who take public transport T Bus or the South Bay shuttle from Andrews Station. A whole complex was developed behind Applebee's and Olive Garden where the old Asian market used to be that sadly had to be ripped out in order to create another Assembly Row project. So crossing the parking lot from Stop and Shop there is a driveway which leads to a new movie theatre; parking lot; stores; and Wahlburgers. Very cozy and airy. My waitress Kayla greeted me and I knew I just basics burger and fries and an ice tea. My drink arrived first and fast. My burger arrived. I took a piece off to taste the meat, because I tend to use condiments as an auto-pilot thing. A basic burger with cheddar cheese can be enjoyed as is. The beef is nicely seasoned and honestly felt guilty adding ketchup and mayo. The downer is the 7.00 you pay for the burger is basically you are paying for the beef. No sides come with it  3.00 for fries. The fries were a bit disappointing for the amount they charged. They were lukewarm as if sitting around on a tray partially heated by a heat lamp. I think between location and liquor license is the reason the prices are so high. Middle upper middle class folk would prob go there for pre or post movie noshing and drinks. Their cocktail menu looks awesome too bad I can't afford food and cocktails. As a solitary diner, it seems like everywhere I go, I feel rushed. Like having a solitary dinner is bad luck or something. I was there after lunch hour rush and before dinner 2-3pm it was slow so what's the deal? Anyway, location and cold fries gives this place 4 stars"
I need Vegan restaurants around me,"Name: 5 North Square; Review: Wow, this might be the most disappointing experience I've had. First off, my girlfriend and are vegan and asked for the vegan menu, yet we were served butter. We specified we were both vegan, a little butter won't kill me, but  I'll pray for anyone with a nut or seafood allergy. We went for lunch and the vegan menu was meant for dinner (and extremely overpriced, considering the quality of our food).  The food was not terrible just extremely overpriced (we did send back the ""vegan"" dish that had butter, and they did replace it with a vegan one, and it's honestly worth wondering if they simply washed it off the butter and added garlic and oil)
Name: MIGHTY LOVE FOOD; Review: What a great eating experience! My wife and I are vegan, so we're always looking for new places to try. They've got LOTS of choices, so it was hard to pick just one dish - I got the vegan mac n cheese and the vegan sloppy joe. But vegan or not, I can tell you it's one of the best mac n cheeses you'll ever have! And the staff was so friendly. They all took turns telling us about the food and treated us like guests. The manager offered to customize any dishes we wanted. If we lived any closer, I might get broke & fat from going here all the time. We'll certainly go back next time we make it into Boston
Name: Chutney's Longwood; Review: Just got a samosa here, but it was tasty and the customer service was super friendly.  Menu wasn't labelled vegan but he spoke vegan for sure.  Sadly the only vegan items on the menu were the samosa side and the chana masala
Name: Pescatore Restaurant; Review: Customer service was outstanding, I was there with two of my friends on a late night Friday. The food was very tasty and well made. The only reason I'm noy giving a 5 star rating it's because they lack knowledge and clear options on vegan dishes, I first introduced myself saying ""I'm vegan so I don't consume animals at all"" the lady offered me Fish then cheese, so it got me worried on how good they would care for my vegan entree
Name: Boloco - Children's Hospital; Review: Just moved to Boston and figured I’d try Boloco since I had an appointment nearby. I’m vegan so for protein I had the tofu but lacked any flavor besides the tofu taste. It was ok, at least with myself being vegan, it was edible but just bland. Chipotle makes better vegan burritos. I was expecting it to be better since I paid almost $12. I’ll try another burritos places and hopefully they are better.  Edit: it was not hard at all to spend $12. Got guacamole and that made it around $11.45. Thank you but no refund needed just won’t return. You should add more vegan (or at least some better than the bland tofu) and then I’d consider trying it again but until then..","Name: Fresh Press; Review: Having a place with so many vegan options right downstairs from my work is amazing. The smoothies are delicious and the pre-packaged snacks are great.  Not the cheapest place, so I wouldn't go every day, but it scratches the itch when you need a little something and don't feel like going out for coffee
Name: MC Kitchen; Review: Simply outstanding. I appreciate that they are Jewish-friendly and recently became kosher certified, and their creative vegan menu is inspiring. The staff behind the counter are super friendly, and they even were serving Discover Vegans’ steak & cheese vegan pastries. The prices here are consistent with everywhere else within Time Out Market. It’ll be exciting to see what else they add to the menu in the future
Name: by CHLOE. - Back Bay; Review: Very spacious and the theme they have of the place is really nice. The food is outstanding. Avocado Toast or Burger or Soup or Air Baked Fries, it's just amazing. They are a Healthy Fast Food restaurant, hence I did not have to worry too much about the kind of bread they'd use. Great motivation for me to stay Vegan :D. The Beet Ketchup and Chipotle Aioli they have is out of this world. Would come over and over. They have really amazing dessert choices in Vegan. Cupcakes to Pancakes to Pastries. They also get you combo here which can be very economical. Something that's missing at their NYC locations. Vegan or not, one should definitely give this chain a try. If you come here once, you'll probably come here more. One can find it a bit pricey but it's worth it
Name: MC Kitchen; Review: Amazingly tasty vegan food with locally sourced ingredients. Presentation is great and the price makes sense too. Have been here twice, liked it a lot both times. Time Out Market Boston is better than its original in Lissabon, there are many other vegan options under the same roof. The bar offers various local ciders too
Name: Oasis Vegan Veggie Parlor; Review: This is one of the top 5 vegetarian restaurants in New England, nevermind Boston!  The food is drop jaw delicious. The atmosphere is a blend of East Africa and Caribbean mixed with just the right amount of hippie and overflowing with love and welcoming energy!  The food is in your face flavorful. You will not walk away from here without tired taste buds, in a good way.  We got the ""everything"", and a tiger blood smoothie.  There was two of us and we couldn't even finish half of the food!!  Took it home for dinner. I think it weighed four pounds!!  The spices in the smoothie made you want to keep sipping, it was addictive.  Love this place, my only complaint is I didn't visit sooner!","Name: Fresh Press; Review: Having a place with so many vegan options right downstairs from my work is amazing.

Such a sight for sore eyes when I saw these vegan empanadas. They are edible, not the best ones I've ever had but decent. Prices are fair. Staff is nice and friendly

Name: Pressed; Review: Stopped in for a quick vegan bite and there were many options ready to grab and go. Recommend the vegan sushi, so good! Butternut squash was excellent too but wasn't sure if it was best cold or hot. There are many smoothie options too and I'll give them a try next time I'm on Charles Street. Very nice Urban decor

Name: Saigon Hut; Review: This is one of the best places to eat pho, period. Not in east Boston, not in Boston. One of the best. I’ve had pho from all across the US and nothing else compares, even in the heart of Vietnamese neighborhoods on the east coast. And it doesn’t just stop at pho - the menu is large and has quite a bit of variety, but everything I’ve had here so far was great. There’s even vegan options available, and according to my vegan friends, the veggie pho is worth raving about too.  I could talk about this place all night.The price is good, the quality is amazing. The owner is so sweet and nice, to the point you feel like family. There isn’t a reason to not eat here. If you like pho, you have to stop here"
I’m looking for Gluten-free options in the area,"Name: Tavern in the Square Shrewsbury; Review: Not impressed. Like many have said, the food is overpriced for what it is, but that wasn't even the big issue. My mother has celiac disease and we have to be very careful about where we eat. She ordered gluten free Mac and cheese and the manager himself brought it over and it had a allergy flag in it.  Then a young woman brought some over after him, which looked totally different. We said we hope that it's not gluten free because she's already had been eating the one the manager brought over. The girl was immediately panicked and absolutely certain she had the gluten free Mac and cheese. While she was checking on it someone else brought over my not gluten free Mac and cheese and we knew by looking at it that the one my mother was eating was not the gluten free one. Small mistake maybe we could seriously land someone in the hospital. Allergies are a serious concern for some and the managers of all people should be aware of what they're bringing over to the table, especially since it looks completely different. That manager then went on to blame his expo mistake on the chef. The general manager came over to have us fill out an injury report to make sure their buts were covered. Do not go here if you have a real allergy
Name: Davio's Northern Italian Steakhouse; Review: I frequent Davio's often for lunch, mostly because it has absolutely scrumptious gluten-free pizza (which is why it made my list of 11 Best Gluten-Free Restaurants in Boston). So when I heard they were adding an extensive gluten-free brunch menu, I jumped at the opportunity to try it out!  Davio's in Boston's Back Bay is a classy place, white tablecloths included. It's perfect for a fancy girl's brunch, a date, or to take your parents to when they're in town.  We started with the Caesar Salad, which was delicious and came with the most scrumptious parmesean crisps. I love how they were generous with the anchovies - for some reason a lot of restaurants skimp out on those, but their salty texture is so great paired with the romaine lettuce!  My sweet tooth was super excited about the gluten-free french toast and berry plate! Sometimes gluten-free bread can be crumbly or more crisp, but these pieces were soft and thicker - perfect for french toast!  N got the gnocchi with mushrooms and truffle oil. He likes the more earthy flavors so this one was a hit!  Prepare yourselves for the epic dessert tray that comes around as a brunch dessert!  At this point we were happily full, but who can say no to dessert, right? So clearly I opted for the flan and berry plate. No regrets! This dish was so decadent, and the vanilla flavor really stood out in the flan and paired nicely with the tart blackberries.  We experienced great service and impeccable meals during our brunch at Davio's - who has a full non-gluten-free menu as well. They have so many options on their menu, which means you can keep going back and getting something new every time. Plus, they're walking distance from the Public Garden, the South End, and shopping on Newbury Street or in the Prudential Mall! I definitely recommend a trip here whether you're gluten free or not
Name: Back Deck; Review: Back deck is literally in my backyard at work so coming here for one is very easy. The staff are nice, the patrons friendly and there is a gluten free menu with satisfying options. I've been here a lot and can not turn down the gluten free meatballs. Whether they have the lamb or turkey, it's a great bit to eat if your not all that hungry or as an appetizer to share. I often don't want to share but I will, no one has disliked them. People are always surprised gluten free food can be this good. They are made well, you can't tell the difference.  The burgers are great and frequently the reason I come here. I do not eat burgers often but when the craving hits, this is my go to option after work for a burger and french fries. Thats right, the french fries are gluten free and delicious so anyone can get them and one wouldn't notice. I like the atmosphere as well, it's an upscale laid back bar, clean and inviting environment.  Whether your looking for lunch, cocktails with appetizers or a burger this is the place to come. The bar is small so don't expect a club scene and the seating is what the name entails, like sitting on a back deck without the outdoor breeze. Without the splinters. Who can resist!!! During the summer they do open the large windows for the summer air, very nice.  This is one of the better restaurants in the area and one I personally prefer. The food is fresh, good selection and low key casual. Great place to hang out!
Name: Real Deal, LLC; Review: This place carries gluten-free options for sandwiches and pizza. This alone is noteworthy--It is really difficult to make gluten-free alternatives. Real Deal deserves kudos for incorporating these options on to their menu. However, after trying them three times now, I can say that they do not have the best gluten-free buns or pizza crust in town. The bun falls apart halfway through eating (I hate sloppy food so this annoys me). The pizza crust stays intact but needs to be cooked longer for my taste--It does not not have that charred look like the normal pizzas. It also comes in one size (and no single-slice option). 3 stars kind of feels harsh, because my fiancee (no allergy) loves Real Deal's regular menu. So, maybe it is 4 stars overall, but I'd say 3 stars specifically for their average tasting g-free options and blase customer service
Name: Giovanni's Roast Beef and Pizza; Review: Super disappointed in this location. As someone with celiac, finding a pizza shop in the Billerica area that serves any form of a gluten free sandwich or wrap and delivers is incredibly difficult.  I've ordered from Giovanni's twice in the last three weeks and each time they have not had gluten free wraps in stock. I called to cancel the second order today and they told me they do not have them because they have to purchase them. To top it they asked me if I ordered frequently enough for them to order wraps. I told them not to bother, because even if I did it's not reliable.  Please, do not advertise gluten free food as available on your site and not have it in stock. Regardless of whether people order frequently or not, if you advertise having it on your menu and available it should be in stock. There are plenty of non - gluten free items on the menu that I am sure are not ordered frequently that are available","Name: Brasserie JO; Review: My nearby hotel recommended Brasserie Jo for breakfast, so I decided to give them a try. The menu said to ask about gluten-free items and I have a gluten intolerance, so I asked. Sometimes it’s nice to have something for breakfast other than eggs while I’m traveling, though I certainly don’t expect it! The reaction of two waitstaff to my question was very unhelpful, though. I was perfectly nice and they were openly annoyed that I had even dared to ask. For those who care, they do have gluten free bread (but nothing else to substitute for breakfast items), but I didn’t stay to eat after being treated like that. They could have been nice about it, at the very least

Name: Al Dente Ristorante; Review: First, I choose this restaurant because of the raving reviews of their attention to detail for people who are gluten free or have Celiac disease. I personally have Celiac disease, so finding an Italian restaurant that is authentic and understanding of cross contamination is super important to me.  I had the gluten free pasta and gluten free garlic bread. The garlic bread was not what you would imagine; it was more like a dense flat bread. It was worth the purchase though. I had the pasta dish at the top of the house specials page with veal, shrimp, and chicken in a garlic wine sauce. I thought it was rather tasteless and the gluten free pene was nothing better than I could've bought from any grocery store. Pretty disappointing for close to $30. Maybe it's because we came 30 minutes before the kitchen closed? But I felt that we were early enough to not be THAT customer.  Al Dente is my girlfriend and her family's favorite Italian restaurant. I had only been here once before about  year ago. I would try it again, but more because it's safe place I can find sustainance for myself and that it has awesome food for people without Celiac disease. I wouldn't return simply to enjoy their food on my own though.  Celiac friendly? Yes. Delicious? Meh. Go cook your own Udi's pasta and save $30

Name: Sultan's Kitchen; Review: They were absolutely lovely. I have gluten and dairy allergies so I have to be extremely careful going out to eat. He listened to my concerns, made appropriate substitutions from his huge knowledge of what is in each dish, and when one of the workers accidentally put cheese on my plate, he made me a new one with care and understanding. Not only was the food excellent, but it was my first time there and I will be back from how well I was treated by the staff. Going out to eat with severe allergies is stressful, but he eased my anxiety and I had 0 reactions.

For those who care, they do have gluten free bread (but nothing else to substitute for breakfast items), but I didn’t stay to eat after being treated like that. They could have been nice about it, at the very least

Name: Real Deal, LLC; Review: This place carries gluten-free options for sandwiches and pizza. This alone is noteworthy--It is really difficult to make gluten-free alternatives. Real Deal deserves kudos for incorporating these options on to their menu. However, after trying them three times now, I can say that they do not have the best gluten-free buns or pizza crust in town. The bun falls apart halfway through eating (I hate sloppy food so this annoys me). The pizza crust stays intact but needs to be cooked longer for my taste--It does not not have that charred look like the normal pizzas. It also comes in one size (and no single-slice option). 3 stars kind of feels harsh, because my fiancee (no allergy) loves Real Deal's regular menu. So, maybe it is 4 stars overall, but I'd say 3 stars specifically for their average tasting g-free options and blase customer service

Name: Al Dente Ristorante; Review: First, I choose this restaurant because of the raving reviews of their attention to detail for people who are gluten free or have Celiac disease. I personally have Celiac disease, so finding an Italian restaurant that is authentic and understanding of cross contamination is super important to me.  I had the gluten free pasta and gluten free garlic bread. The garlic bread was not what you would imagine; it was more like a dense flat bread. It was worth the purchase though. I had the pasta dish at the top of the house specials page with veal, shrimp, and chicken in a garlic wine sauce. I thought it was rather tasteless and the gluten free pene was nothing better than I could've bought from any grocery store. Pretty disappointing for close to $30. Maybe it's because we came 30 minutes before the kitchen closed? But I felt that we were early enough to not be THAT customer.  Al Dente is my girlfriend and her family's favorite Italian restaurant. I had only been here once before about  year ago. I would try it again, but more because it's safe place I can find sustainance for myself and that it has awesome food for people without Celiac disease. I wouldn't return simply to enjoy their food on my own though.  Celiac friendly? Yes. Delicious? Meh. Go cook your own Udi's pasta and save $30

Name: Davio's Northern Italian Steakhouse; Review: I frequent Davio's often for lunch, mostly because it has absolutely scrumptious gluten-free pizza (which is why it made my list of 11 Best Gluten-Free Restaurants in Boston). So when I heard they were adding an extensive gluten-free brunch menu, I jumped at the opportunity to try it out!  Davio's in Boston's Back Bay is a classy place, white tablecloths included. It's perfect for a fancy girl's brunch, a date, or to take your parents to when they're in town.  We started with the Caesar Salad, which was delicious and came with the most scrumptious parmesean crisps. I love how they were generous with the anchovies - for some reason a lot of restaurants skimp out on those, but their salty texture is so great paired with the romaine lettuce!  My sweet tooth was super excited about the gluten-free french toast and berry plate! Sometimes gluten-free bread can be crumbly or more crisp, but these pieces were soft and thicker - perfect for french toast!  N got the gnocchi with mushrooms and truffle oil. He likes the more earthy flavors so this one was a hit!  Prepare yourselves for the epic dessert tray that comes around as a brunch dessert!  At this point we were happily full, but who can say no to dessert, right? So clearly I opted for the flan and berry plate. No regrets! This dish was so decadent, and the vanilla flavor really stood out in the flan and paired nicely with the tart blackberries.  We experienced great service and impeccable meals during our brunch at Davio's - who has a full non-gluten-free menu as well. They have so many options on their menu, which means you can keep going back and getting something new every time. Plus, they're walking distance from the Public Garden, the South End, and shopping on Newbury Street or in the Prudential Mall! I definitely recommend a trip here whether you're gluten free or not

Name: Sultan's Kitchen; Review: They were absolutely lovely. I have gluten and dairy allergies so I have to be extremely careful going out to eat. He listened to my concerns, made appropriate substitutions from his huge knowledge of what is in each dish, and when one of the workers accidentally put cheese on my plate, he made me a new one with care and understanding. Not only was the food excellent, but it was my first time there and I will be back from how well I was treated by the staff. Going out to eat with severe allergies is stressful, but he eased my anxiety and I had 0 reactions. Highly recommend","Name: Giovanni's Roast Beef and Pizza; Review: Super disappointed in this location. As someone with celiac, finding a pizza shop in the Billerica area that serves any form of a gluten free sandwich or wrap and delivers is incredibly difficult.  I've ordered from Giovanni's twice in the last three weeks and each time they have not had gluten free wraps in stock. I called to cancel the second order today and they told me they do not have them because they have to purchase them. To top it they asked me if I ordered frequently enough for them to order wraps. I told them not to bother, because even if I did it's not reliable.  Please, do not advertise gluten free food as available on your site and not have it in stock. Regardless of whether people order frequently or not, if you advertise having it on your menu and available it should be in stock. There are plenty of non - gluten free items on the menu that I am sure are not ordered frequently that are available

Name: All Star Pizza Bar; Review: Such a great find!! It was exactly what we were looking for. First- they have gluten free crusts and vegan cheese. Second - a super wide range of choices and toppings to choose from. A pie can be expensive ($31 for gluten free and vegan cheese) but it seems on par for Boston pricing. Super quick service and the AC is on full blast

Name: Chill Kitchen and Bar; Review: I have been dinning at Chill since they opened last year. I am always satisfied with the food, service, and experience.  Recently, my husband has been diagnosed with Celiac disease, so he truly needs gluten free options. We went to Chill for dinner with friends this weekend and were pleasantly surprised with the gluten free options. Our waitress told us almost all menu options (with a couple of exceptions) can be made gluten free - even the burgers. The owners, John and Coleen, have decided to stock gluten free breads and sauces (no gluten in their soy), etc. and make sure they are cooked separately. If you are gluten free especially because of an allergy, this place is an absolute must!!  If you don't have dietary restrictions, I recommend anything on the menu. I specifically enjoy the steak and cheese egg rolls and the Chill chop salad with chicken salad on top

Name: Brasserie JO; Review: My nearby hotel recommended Brasserie Jo for breakfast, so I decided to give them a try. The menu said to ask about gluten-free items and I have a gluten intolerance, so I asked. Sometimes it’s nice to have something for breakfast other than eggs while I’m traveling, though I certainly don’t expect it! The reaction of two waitstaff to my question was very unhelpful, though.

I want Kosher food near me,"Name: MC Kitchen; Review: Simply outstanding. I appreciate that they are Jewish-friendly and recently became kosher certified, and their creative vegan menu is inspiring. The staff behind the counter are super friendly, and they even were serving Discover Vegans’ steak & cheese vegan pastries. The prices here are consistent with everywhere else within Time Out Market. It’ll be exciting to see what else they add to the menu in the future
Name: CHINA GARDEN; Review: My son love this place n he happy that it near us... food are so delicious and fresh.. good quality!!.
Name: Doretta Taverna & Raw Bar; Review: This place is an absolute hidden gem. It's so convenient, but I never would've noticed it if I hadn't come across it in the Seated app. It's near Boston common, right near the end of Boylston. The food is amazing god damn. It's like fancier Greek food, so not your typical place but everything is so good. I got the lamb pasta and was one of my better decisions of the week. Go check them out
Name: Chicken and Rice Guys; Review: Pretty nice food, very very reasonable price. Probably my favorite fast food place near my home right now. The only down side is it only open to 10, so have to plan early for a late night bite
Name: Temptations Cafe; Review: Pretty good sandwiches and not too expensive. The place can be busy around lunch time, and even though the wait isn't too long, there's not a lot of space inside. On a nice day, get your food to go and take it too the park near the MFA","Name: Exodus Bagels; Review: I had almost given up on trying to find a bagel in MA that measures up to NY standards. Outside of NY metro area, these are the best bagels I've had. Also the best challah I've ever had from anywhere. Their pandemic setup with online ordering and pickup is very quick, easy and felt safe.  I ordered plain, everything, and dark rye bagels. Pretty much no remaining hole, which is good for sandwiches. Cutting into it, I was surprised to see more/larger air gaps inside than I am accustomed to. But upon eating, it really had the right amount of chew and the crust was just right. It really just tastes like a quality NY bagel. I had practically given up on trying to find a bagel in MA that measures up to NY quality. I've tried Bagelsaurus, Rosenfelds, Iggy's, Bagel World... you name it. All disappointing IMO. After living in Queens for a couple years, I've been spoiled.  The everything bagel was my favorite. For the dark rye, the rye flavor was on the milder side. I could have used a little more, but at least it wasn't overpowering.  I also ordered challah, which you can only get on Fridays, and that was superb. When I first saw it, I was concerned perhaps it was baked too long because it looked a little dark, but it was perfect. Just perfect flavor and texture. Supple but sturdy, excellent crust, sweet but not too sweet. This is one of the few loaves of bread I would not hesitate to pay the hefty $9 price.  I also ordered the chicken liver pate... which is reminiscent of chopped liver but a little different. It's smooth like a pate, and seems to be a bit heavy on the schmaltz and the salt. It's enjoyable, but I'll probably skip this one in the future. It's good and worth a try, but I gotta warn the purists. If you want really good classic chopped liver, IMO you're better off getting it from Michael's Deli or Mahmelah's.  I also got the smoked salmon which was good. It's Acme brand, which IMO is pretty much as good as it gets except for Barney Greengrass and Zabars in NYC. At $12/8oz it's a very fair price, too. You can save a couple bucks getting the 8 oz Nova Pieces at Trader Joe's, which despite the TJ label I'm pretty sure is also sourced from Acme, but this seemed more tender and the slices were bigger pieces
Name: BOSTON KABOB COMPANY; Review: The food in this place is the best mediterranean food I had in Boston area, and is better than many places in Israel

Name: Inna's Kitchen - Boston Public Market; Review: In all fairness, this wasn't quite what we were looking for. We were looking for brunch with GF DF offerings. This is a tiny Jewish deli with very limited seating. Much better suited to take out. I was pleased to be able to order GF DF Challah French Toast, but was disappointed that they were out of the cinnamon swirl. That being said, the Pastrami hash was very good & my family enjoyed their sandwiches & wedge fries.  I'd recommend it for lunch, but not so much for breakfast.  Excellent fresh squeezed OJ was a big plus
Name: Inna's Kitchen - Boston Public Market; Review: DINNER REVIEW  Inna's had been on my list for a while since it served traditional Jewish food in an artisanal food space (the Boston Public Market). I had heard you have to get the shakalatkes (shakshuka plus latkes, a very enticing concept) so I, of course, ordered those plus a falafel pita. Service was quick and we sat down with our food pretty quickly.  The falafel pita was good, the falafel tasted fresh, as did the toppings. I would get that one again. However, the shakalatkes were a little disappointing. I felt like the shakshuka took over the whole thing and it was just the sauce overpowering the soggy patties of potatoes. I think a larger and crispier latke would have provided a better overall eating experience.  I would come back for the falafel, not for the shakalatke","Name: Exodus Bagels; Review: I had almost given up on trying to find a bagel in MA that measures up to NY standards.

Name: NY Shawarma Guys; Review: These guys are located right across the street from my apartment! They have been nothing but so friendly and generous! Their food is absolutely delightful and well seasoned and cooked! My mom loves the lamb and I love the chicken. Shawarma is one of our favorite foods along with the meat pies and fries and salad! I highly recommend!  Great Prices, Grear Shawarma!!!!","Name: Chicked's Chicken & Grill; Review: Went for a quick lunch bite. Nice place!  Inside is clean and inviting.  The owner Dee was working and super friendly!!  I keep kosher and was excited that there was no dairy in the breading for the chicken.  They have amazing fried chicken and they make their bbq and hot sauce in house and it's amazing!!  Two thumbs up

Name: Uptowne Mediterranean Restaurant; Review: It was after 8 pm and we needed something for dinner, but not the usual pizza or whatever. I searched on my phone for ""takeout dinner near here"" and Uptowne Mediterranean came up. I didn't even know it was there, but we always fly past the shopping area at 50 mph.  It's not a fancy place, but it's pleasant, and the owner was very friendly and proud of his food, and made suggestions for next time. The food was marvelous, very tasty, and surprisingly light. The chicken kebabs were delicious, the salad on the side was fresh, and the felafels were among the best I've had

Name: Amsterdam Falafelshop; Review: Awesome Falafel shop now in Kenmore square in addition to their Davis square location.  Finally a place to get good and quick falafels and french fries in town.  I have been waiting for a place like this for a while after going to Maoz and other shops with similar concepts.  The self serve toppings are great and lots of options that I have never seen before but work really well.  The prices are reasonable and this location is bigger then the Davis so there is more space to sit.  Overall a must try if you are craving falafel

Name: Cafe Jaffa; Review: Cafe Jaffa is an AMAZING place to eat! The service is exceptional.  Our waitress was so nice and accommodating for our food allergies.  The service was very quick! The food was excellent - its my favorite place to get middle eastern food in Boston. We ordered the chicken schwarma, falafel plate, rice pilaf and the humus plate.  It was all delicious! I would recommend this place to anyone! It is the perfect place for a casual date or lunch break.  They also do takeout orders, which is incredibly convenient if you are in a rush"
Give me some Halal restaurants nearby,"Name: Chicken And Rice Guys; Review: For the price, the taste and portion size are top notch. I've been to the Halal Guys in NY, and maybe because this is a store where they can keep fresh ingredients, but I felt this was much better.  We had the Halal Chicken with rice combo plate, and the chicken was juicy and tender. I also loved the broad sauce selection, which again seemed a great improvement to the packaged sauce that the Halal Guys give you. Here you can douse your plate with bottles of hot sauce (medium or extra spicy), mint chutney, or garlic white sauce. All of them tasted fresh and delicious.  The person working the cash register had some attitude when we were placing our order, so that would be the one thing I'd dock a star for. But luckily since it's a take and go place we didn't have to deal with too long
Name: The Halal Guys; Review: Halal Guys has stepped up their game during this COVID19 pandemic and have made the necessary changes in order to not only keep their customers safe but also their employees! Bravo. You have to wear a mask in order to step into this establishment. They've also set up a barrier so that you're at least 6 feet away from the staff.  They are still serving up the same, delicious food. Is it the same as the infamous food cart in NYC? Almost. The thing that sets Halal Guys above all other halal places is that red sauce! It's super hot but doesn't mess up the flavor of your food. You don't have to add much to bring on the heat. I love practically drowning my platters with white sauce and adding at least 4 lines of that red sauce. The beef gyro sandwich is also on point. They really fill it up so you get a full sandwich. I also dig how that pita bread is so soft
Name: Boston Pita Cafe; Review: Not expensive but at the same time not very delicious. The staff were friendly and we talked to them about Halal meat. They have chicken halal shawarma (Noor al- Jabal). Will visit again. It is a small, sweet place, and very much in the mall, and their food is permissible because they use mountain light. But eating them means it is not good, especially the shawarma, and their prices are not expensive
Name: Shah's Halal Food; Review: Didn't expect it but, Shah's Halal Food was remarkable. Delightful menu items at really good prices, wonderful ambience to unwind at. You can order pretty much anything on the menu and not be disappointed. Bonus that their service is so great, they are so quick and helpful. Shah's Halal Food is Really really unique and awesome
Name: Chicken and Rice Guys; Review: Good food. Good quantity. Price is good for the amount of food available. Halal chicken is served with rice. It would be better if customers were able to choose between the type of salad they want with their order but overall a good experience","Name: The Halal Guys; Review: I used to live across the street from a Halal Guys in Chicago so I was happy they have one here in Boston. When you compare it to other fast-casual chains like Cava, Sweet Green, or Chipotle, it's definitely more ""bare bones"" and less fancy. They definitely don't have a ""health"" equity and they don't have many options. But dang this place is delicious. I always get the regular combo platter which comes with beef and chicken, yellow rice, lettuce, and tomatoes. It's also a significant portion for the price which I appreciate.  Servers are friendly but there's not much seating so better to-go than eat-in.  Come in for a quick bite and get the white sauce and a little spicy (it's VERY spicy and I tend to like spicy)  Share review Write an update Edit revie

Name: Tawakal Halal Cafe; Review: I live down the street from this restaurant, which is deep in the heart of Jeffries Point, Eastie (you can see the airport runways through the windows outside). Sitting down for dinner feels like you're in the kitchen of someones home. Its a bit small and cramped, but its a genuine neighborhood spot.  I tried the vegetable sambusa's, chicken chapati, and chicken biryani. It was all extremely fresh, delicious, comforting, and affordable. You can see them making the fresh chapati/roti (a type of flat bread akin to naan) right in the kitchen, and it was the highlight for me. The entire staff was welcoming and accommodating, and the owner/chef came to greet us with a big smile. He seems genuinely elated to be opening this restaurant.  I will absolutely come back for more
Name: Shah's Halal Food; Review: Their chicken is so good!! The meat itself is wonderful. I get the chicken pita. The chicken platter with rice is good too, but I like the type of pita they have here. It's soft and chewy. Would recommend this place, but the menu items are hit or miss sometimes. The white sauce with onions or lettuce are the toppings I recommen

Name: Mehak Halal Cuisine; Review: This is definitely a hidden gem. If you only look at the photos, you may not want to try it and that is mistake! I gave it a four star because there was basically no service in this place and the ambience wasn’t nice, but the food was fantastic.  A few tips: Bring someone who can speak Punjabi with you, so they can communicate. The waiter/cook speaks broken English. Not everything on the menu is available, so ask them before you order. This is a CASH ONLY place! You don’t come here for the service. You may need to ask for a fork if you need.  There are three must order dishes: mango lassi, keema naan, and shammi kebabs. I have tried so many Indian restaurants, and I can guarantee you this is the best mango lassi in Boston. You can feel that you are drinking real mango. But the mango lassi here is very thick and filling, so just keep that in mind. My husband is Indian and he was so addicted to it as well. We also ordered garlic naan, but my husband and our Punjabi friend said it was okay, no where compared to the keema naan. I don’t know how they can make the meat so fine and almost melted inside the naan. Genius","Name: The Halal Guys; Review: Yay, so happy now they have franchised and in Boston.  If you do not know about the original location. See the Halal Guys on 53rd and 6th in New York City. One of Yelp's most reviewed locations.  Simple, affordable, tasty.  I like the combo plate and get plenty of sauce to go if you do not plan on finishing it there. Watch out for the hot sauce, it is as it has always been. Not for the ""mild"" hot sauce folks. You should just avoid it all together if you can't take the heat.  As far as I can tell, it is using the same ingredients and because they've franchised it is only as consistent as the food freshness turn over. Granted you're not getting the NYC authentic feeling as you did waiting in line and purchasing a $5 plate of goodness. Recently the cart locations have raised their prices to $8. Boston location's price is about $11 and some change with the tax included. IMHO this is a fair price since they have to pay for rent, and hopefully paying the workers a fair wage, etc.  PS w/o these guys, there wouldn't be a chicken and rice guys, they put halal chicken and rice on the map and main stream, but to be fair chk & rice guys were first to market in Bosto

Name: Podima Pizza; Review: I love this place and I try to visit once a week! It is run by two fabulous Palestinian gentlemen, so make sure you get their hummus and shawarma!! Their hummus brings me back to the middle east--nowhere else in the city that does that for me.  Their pizza is also yummy. Everything is also halal

Name: Darbar; Review: Ok peeps. Moved to Boston just a few months back and trying to track down good wholesome halal eats. Came from the Chi so knew it would be a task.Read about  this place tucked away on a side road.The reviews were not that encouraging  and was skeptical at first but I’m really happy I still went for it. The food is really really good.You will most likely come across the owner duo , very helpful gents. The server staff looked like fresh meat and didn’t know what they were doing , but hey I just came for the food which was spot on. I thought earlier that I had found my Biryani go to spot in Boston , but I changed my mind...this is my new go to place now. The bread is fresh and tastes awesome. They have a buffet menu  most days and I heard that their buffet during Ramadan is worth it.Overall this is a really good place for desi dishes and should not disappoint . Plus point is that there is reasonable street parking available

Name: Mirchi Nation-Indian Kitchen; Review: It is a Halal restaurant, they've halal certificate.  I've advised them to get listed on Zabeeha App (They're not listed as of now)  Food 2*- I am sorry but 2 star to the Biryani I ordered. It was not a Biryani, it was moreover Fried Rice with too much oil and spice. I was super hungry to did not argue, just ate it. I tried Irani Chae, it was good.  People 5* - Five star to the people out there, Manager/Owner walked up to me took feedback for the food I ordered, he was a nice person. Other staffs (Another guy and a girl wearing hizaab) were also great and easy to talk. They tried their best to give me positive experience and they were successful in it. I liked their hospitality, and really felt like eating at home or with some near and dear ones.  Place is comparatively small but clean (not that too small). I wish they would have served real Biryani and not selling Fried Rice on the name of Biryani.  I'll try some other food at this place (maybe tomorrow), hope to get better food this time.  Yes, they're not Mirchi. They're 'Mirchi Nation'.  I have tried Biryani at Mirchi (Edison), no complain. Awesome Hyderabadi Biryani

Name: The Halal Guys; Review: Overpriced and average to low quality. I only ever had halal guys in NYC for roughly $5-6. I ordered today for the 1st time in Boston from the new fast food storefront that opened up and I got a mixed regular bowl, fries, and 2 orders of baklava. My total was around $25. When I opened my order and expected at least 2 regular pieces of baklava per order, I found 1 small piece for $2.45 each. They were in separate boxes, so definitely no mix up - 1 small piece per 1 order. The baklava was dry and tasted like a bad version of Greek baklava rather than Arab baklava. Even in NyC (with higher prices), baklava this size doesn’t cost this much, and we are talking about top of the line, in a $$$$ expensive restaurant, maybe you’d pay $2.50 per large piece. After I saw the baklava in my order, the rest of the order didn’t matter anymore, as my first impression was pure disappointment! The fries were terrible (worse than McD), I threw them out. Pictures of baklava attached"

Name: anoush'ella; Review: I am OBSESSED with this place lol. I used to work full time over at Boston medical center and was always curious about the construction. When it finally opened and I had the chance to get over there, I was in heaven. The service was excellent like I mean these people sat there and explained the whole menu and helped me pick something out, so friendly and they came around from behind the counter. Extremely personal just overall excellent customer service. The food is to die. I love that it’s fresh, healthy, unique Mediterranean cuisine. So many options to choose from and none disappoint. Many vegan options which is so nice, I’m always trying something new every time i come in and it’s alwaya full of fresh flavor and served beautifully. Espresso and full wine/beer bar. Literally the best place everything in one. And to top it off it’s totally cool open space with lots of seating and pretty sweet interior designing. Lol personally I’ve never been this obsessed with a restaurant I rave about it constantly
Name: Cósmica; Review: ********************************* Review during the COVID-19 pandemic (Dine-In): This is a mexican cuisine restaurant with outdoor seating available on reservation during the pandemic. They have limited options in food, just tacos and bowl options with some of small sides like chips queso guacamole etc. And also just 1 option in taco or bowl category in the vegan/vegetarian/gf. So, if you're a vegan or vegetarian then this might not be the place for you if you're looking for a good variety of menu options. But the quality of the food was very good. They have regular drinks options as well and I'd say they're enough for a restaurant.  The location and place ambience was really good.  The staff was really courteous and welcoming and they kept the place very clean.  Overall 4/5, maybe 3.5. they're good but they can improve in terms of providing more options in food menu to attract more customers, but I understand they're trying to keep it authentic and keep it standard in terms of their expertise and policy.  And I definitely recommend this place👍 ********************************
Name: Dates and Olives; Review: It was my first Mediterranean food in Boston and my wife and I had a very pleasant experience out there. We ordered a chicken sandwich and brown rice bowl with three toppings. My wife pointed out the portion where they seem to be smaller than other Mediterranean restaurants but for me, the quality and freshness of the food were excellent that the portion fits perfect for me. When we visited the place around noon, it was very chill and quiet place to talk with my wife without disturbance. Highly recommend for local people or newcomers to Brookline/ Brighton area who wants to have healthy food with a quick bite. And last but least the Mango Lassi was the finale","Name: Mediterranean Grill; Review: Place is well managed. Great selection of sandwiches, soups and pastas. Pricing is reasonable. Staff are attentive and keep the lines moving quick even though the place can get crowded. Sandwiches are the way to go if you want to be in and out quickly
Name: Mediterranean Grill; Review: Our company orders from here at least once a week, and has been a staple for many years.  Large portions make most meals sufficient for two, excellent customer service always, and consistent quality of food.  Fabulous salads with REAL marinated chicken, fresh greens and veggies, home made soups, great wraps and sandwiches.  Always happy when we go here!  Oh, and they deal with our extras and special orders every time
Name: Dates and Olives; Review: Welcoming and friendly chef-proprietor with a charming, positive attitude and an interesting, adventurous, international as well as cross-country life and career story to tell. Delicious and beautiful Mediterranean food. Authentic, well-varied dishes, thoughtfully crafted, with distinctive, inventive ingredients and combinations. Very healthy and vegetarian-friendly, too, though also with plenty of meat available. The restaurant is good to sit down in small groups or for takeout, and it has a burrito-bar setup that allows for easy customization.  Well-priced for those with modest budgets, though slightly out of reach for people with very limited incomes. Maybe the owner could add more low-priced sides or samples of their excellent food to cater to every income level, as well as those just looking for a snack. While keeping median price points high enough to stay profitable and in business. Still, without question a great success, full of delicious, authentically Mediterranean, and healthy options, one well-worth visiting
Name: Cafe Med; Review: As a vegetarian and world traveler, I was so lucky to find Cafe Med in Boston. Cafe Med not only has a wide variety of vegetarian options, they use authentic Greek and Middle Eastern recipes!  I usually order the Spinach Pie and Greek Salad, along with a veggie rollup. Did I mention  that you can stray from the menu and build your own sandwiches and salads? Well you can!  Cafe Med also has a great ambiance with soothing Greek music playing over the sound system and Eclectic decor.  Cafe Med is also a block away from the MBTA's Arlington station on Green line, so its convenient for me to have lunch there during the week.  Every time I leave Cafe Med I feel satisfied and refreshed
Name: Zest Mediterranean Grille; Review: Super fresh food, expertly made, in short. I had the  Falafel Plate that comes with three sides. Everything was top-notch. the falafel balls seemed like they just came out of the fryer...still warm and steaming inside. Often at many places these are dry inside. These were moist with a slightly crunch outside, with a delicious flavor, made even more so by the spicy tahini sauce I picked. I had three sides out of what looks like 12 or so choices; a great selection. Everything looked great but I wanted to compare to other places so chose the tabbouleh salad and the fattoush salads, as well as the moussaka. Everything was very fresh with high-quality ingredients IMO. The tabbouleh was delicious, well-balanced and bright with the right amount of lemon juice. The fattoush was delicious and refreshing; I really enjoyed the small amount of mint in it. Finally, the moussaka is something I had not had before. It was delicious with its chick peas and stewed eggplant and tomatoes.  I really appreciate a place like this in general, but especially when traveling when it seems so hard to get fresh, healthy food. This place is a gem. The food and environment is kid-friendly and I can't wait to bring my family back here. Zest, please keep on doing what you are doing!","Name: Dates and Olives; Review: Welcoming and friendly chef-proprietor with a charming, positive attitude and an interesting, adventurous, international as well as cross-country life and career story to tell.

Name: Uptowne Mediterranean Restaurant; Review: Best chicken shawarma I've ever had, hands-down. I like it as a fatoush add-on, with a generous schmear of the most amazing garlic sauce, making a simultaneously healthy and decadent meal. The chicken kabobs (both spiced ground meat and marinated chunk versions) are also great. For vegetarian options, the falafel (freshly fried-to-order, not microwaved) and pumpkin kibbeh are fantastic. Honestly, pretty much everything on the menu is really good; if I weren't so addicted to the shawarma fatoush, I'd order other items more often. For those with a sweet tooth, they bake fresh trays daily of baklava and kanafeh. Haven't tried the baklava, but the kanafeh (sort of a Lebanese cheesecake) is a delightful treat.  Wonderful, hard-working Lebanese family runs this establishment. Can taste the home-cooked love that gets put into every dish. Big props to them for continuing to grind through this pandemic. Miss being able to enjoy meals in their dining room, but even in takeout the quality of the food remains as sky-high as before

Name: Noon Mediterranean; Review: I absolutely love Mediterranean food. This is the McDonald's of that. Plenty of seating, a little over priced, server had to keep reading directions for ingredients. If things were explained better I would have opted out of a few sides. I ordered the lamb meatball special. Spicy, good, and expected to be soft. However I bit hard into a bone. This cracked my tooth threw and I now need a crown. I'm left 50/50 because if there was bone it must be fresh lamb and missed it. But the lack and rush of service overrated that. And the 1k in dental expenses. Chew carefully","Name: Andre's Cafe; Review: Conveniently located across from Boston Medical Center, this place serves a lot of folks in scrubs, patients, hospital visitors and local construction workers.  The counter service is friendly and quick and the food is serviceable and includes veggie options. We had the Vegetarian Meze Platter which featured falafel, hummus, grilled eggplant, grape leaves, tabouleh and a bit of green salad with tahini and pita.  The food was nothing special, and the falafel was very dry, but the meal was filling and relatively healthy.  One of the better options (open evenings) in this area

Name: Uptowne Mediterranean Restaurant; Review: I found out Uptowne Mediterranean Restaurant by accident. I was shopping in the plaza where it's located and it was lunch time so I wanted to give it a shot. They have great food for really great prices. The chicken and meat shawerma is as fresh as it can be. They cut it off the big rotating skewer and make your meal. The kebabs, appetizers, salads and fixing all are authentic Mediterranean recipes. Lots of Vegetarian choices as well. Falafel, Spinach pie etc. It's a family run business and everyone helping each other and the customers. I started also using them to cater for our company lunches. They make big platters also can make sandwiches. It's the best thing I discovered which reminds me of home. Thanks for your time reading this review

Name: PITA Restaurant; Review: They have nice decorations and a lot of seating. Pita has an overall friendly environment and quick service.  I ordered homemade pita bread. This pita bread comes with 3 dipping sauce options. I asked for tzatziki. The other two options are spicy feta and hummus. The price of pita bread is Three dollars and 50 cents. The pita bread is made freshly once you place the order. Which is a plus if you are tired of eating thick rubbery pita bread from the grocery store. I liked the texture. But I was disappointed with tzatziki. It did not have enough olive oil and I didn’t taste any garlic and cucumber. I couldn’t taste any flavors. Next time I will try another dipping sauce with the pita bread or Greek fries or Greek salad or a veggie wrap Overall review of this place: Food Taste: 5 out of 10 Overall ambience: 7 out of 10 Service: 8 out of 10 Overall Rating: 6 out of 10 Comment: Will be back but for another veggie optio

Name: Archie's Place; Review: One of the only places in the area to actually get a breakfast with bacon and eggs or French toast.   I love to get the steak tips with rice pilaf and mashed potatoes for lunch. I’m not big on all the Mediterranean stuff that seems to be popping up in the area so Archie’s is one of my go to’s for lunch.  Friendly staff also"
Where are Chinese food places that do delivery,"Name: South Ocean; Review: My family's favorite Chinese food in So. Boston❤️
Name: Yummy Kitchen; Review: Hands down one of the best Chinese places around! The food is great and delivered fast! I have nothing bad to say and would highly recommend this place if you want Chinese food that won't make you sick with MSG! I order from them all the time at work! I truly believe some people have different taste in places but since the remodel this restaurant has vastly improved
Name: Shun's Kitchen; Review: Best neighborhood Chinese restaurant for a recent Chinese immigrant who are not from the Cantonese culture. American Chinese food is good enough for non Chinese but too boring for new Chinese immigrants. Shun’s kitchen is determined to bring authentic Chinese food to the table mixed with great traditional favorite. The owner Shawn and his crew are awesome. So blessed they are close to me. My favorite is still being discovered since they keep on updating their menu. But if you are confident about taking bones out of fish, try the whole fish. The pork belly is my all time favorite. It’s almost as good as my mom’s cooking
Name: Joyful Garden; Review: I went here with five co-workers as the first place we went to was completely full for the chinese buffet in Newton. The location could be better as it's connected to the Holiday Inn I believe, you actually have to go inside the hotel lobby to get to the restaurant, but now to the food.  The menu is standard ""American"" Chinese fare, although they have another menu that is completely in Chinese. One of our co-workers speaks Chinese and was conversing and even ordered using this menu which we thought was quite authentic of this Chinese restaurant. The service was quite good, filling up our drinks whenever they were less than half full, the food came out quite quickly and we were all pleased with the taste of the food.  The price was similar to other Chinese food restaurants and had a lunch menu with various options allowing you to choose 3 or 4 different items for a combo meal, all around $8. The food, although quite good, left me wanting more, I only wish the portions were a bit larger. I would definitely come back here though for another co-worker luncheon as we all had a great time, good conversation, and ate well
Name: 7 Chinese Restaurant; Review: I have tried MANY Chinese restaurants in the West Roxbury area but the 7 restaurant is the best.  What is really ridiculous is that they do not deliver.  I would gladly pay more than the standard delivery fee rather that get a delivery from a restaurant that is not as good.  I think the owner of this restaurant is shortsighted and should rethink the use of a delivery company.  Very, very disappointed.  But it's a really great restaurant and when possible will still get food from them","Name: CHINA GARDEN; Review: Good food. 4 stars because they only do cash. The no delivery aspect of it I believe is why, the food is so good
Name: New Style Asian Food; Review: Tried them for the first time last week, put the order through then realized it said ""Pickup"" so I called them immediately, and lady said ""we don't usually deliver"" I told her it states specifically on their website DELIVERY with a green check mark. Then she said ""ok, we do it""  Then it arrives, nice man....then i see the fried wontons and went into shock..it looked like a box of Chinese Doritos. The flavor was there but no filling and no traditional twisting of the dough. ANYONE can take a slice of won ton dough from the market and cut it in half and then you've got two triangles and you toss it into hot oil and fry..simplest thing. A little kid could do it, that is NOT a fried won ton..it's fried dough, A RIP OFF, same as at Jade Pacifica. I ordered CRISPY sesame chicken...got the sesames, but they packed it in a plastic container with a lide so it sweated...plenty of sesame but the chicken was moist and mushy. All crispiness gone. These places are getting top dollar and giving sub par food, same as Jade Pacifica. I'll never order out again, luckily I can cook all these myself I was just trying to celebrate my hospital homecoming and successful surgery. ALSO, if they don't deliver they should take it off their website where they advertise it and STILL have the green checkmark beside the DELIVERY option. Really, can't anyone have any honesty anymore
Name: Chinese Dragon; Review: I just ordered this filth off of DoorDash. I live in chelsea and I’ve struggled to find a good Chinese food spot. This place had a high rating on the app so I gave it a go. The food was delivered quickly and the portions were big. I ordered; general Gao’s chicken, orange chicken, pork fried rice, chicken lo mein, spare ribs and chicken fingers. Fairly simple and standard order. The chicken fingers were the only highlight of the meal and even those were slightly over cooked. Pretty sure the orange chicken and the general Gao’s were exactly the same and equally as disgusting. They were burnt and dry. The Lo Mein and pork fried rice had no flavor and the spare ribs were rubbery. I also found a piece of plastic in my pork fried rice.  Lastly, this is the first time as a Chinese food customer that I didn’t receive a fortune cookie. Fingers crossed I don’t get sick. The night is young and steer clear of this joint! Yuck

The food is great, our favorite is the chicken cutlet sub and fries. Delivery is fast and prompt. The pizza is the best around and I know pizza

Name: JP Kitchen; Review: I was craving a little bit of Chinese  Food. The front counter girl was fantastic and friendly. It's a nice size restaurant  and VERY  clean. Told the front end staff that the last Chinese restaurant in Boston was horrible. This place gave me great food. Awesome and fresh- hot too. Prices are good too. I am not from Boston and I am trying to find food that is good when i do work in Boston

Name: Canton Eatery; Review: This place has awful customer service. We ordered two entrees, one large and one regular. As GrubHub stated, large entrees come with rice. After it was delivered, we noticed the rice was missing. Additionally, the Kung Pao chicken was very bland and flavorless. We called the restaurant, hoping they could correct the problem. Whoever answered the phone was rude from the very beginning. First she said the entrees we ordered did not come with rice, and saidsonly large entrees do. I clarified the sizes of our entrees, and she ammended her statement to ""the large Kung Pao chicken does not come with rice."" Even after citing the GrubHub menu, she maintained that a large Kung Pao chicken does not come with rice. She offered no apology for her rudeness, substandard service, or poor cooking. We will not be ordering from here again, and would encourage others to double check their deliveries in the future.  I have worked in the restaurant industry for 8 years, and would never treat a customer this way. I hope this business owner sees this so he/she can take action

Name: Sichuan Gourmet Billerica; Review: Best Restaurant in Billerica. You might at first be thrown off by this tiny restaurant's appearance, crammed in a tiny strip mall with a liquor store and a laundromat, but don't let that fool you. Sichuan Gourmet has, hands down, the best food in Billerica, and for Chinese food beats any of the Chinatown places I've been to. The trick is to not order typical ""American"" Chinese dishes like Beef and Broccoli or Sweet and Sour Chicken, which are not very good here, -- the dishes you've never heard of are going to be the best.  I should at this point mention that because the cuisine is from the Sichuan region, much of their food is spicy. Unlike many places, when they put those pepper symbols on the menu, they mean it. However, the spiciness is never a raw overpowering burning -- they dishes carefully balance ""Ma"" (a tingly, electric sensation), ""La"" (spicy), and ""Tang"" (a hot burning sensation) with sweet and savory flavors that can convert many people who think they hate spicy food. They aren't just adding cayenne to their dishes like so many other places do. They also have plenty of non-spicy dishes, and are happy to make any of their menu items less spicy.  For spicy dishes, my favorites are the ""Pork and Eggplant with Yu Xiang Sauce"" which appears on their separate specials menu (it has perfect balance of spicy sauce, sweet eggplant, and savory pork), the Dan Dan Noodles (which the waiter should warn you need to be mixed before eating), any of the ""with Spicy Chili Sauce"" dishes (which are meat or fish served in a red spicy sauce with Napa Cabbage), the ""Old Sichuan Chicken"" (a dried fried chicken with an interesting crust -- the house specialty), the ""Gangou Dry Fish Filet"" (similar to the Old Sichuan Chicken but with fish), the ""Sliced Roast Beef & Tendon w. Chili Sauce"" (if you like tendon), and the ""Hot & Sour Wonton Soup"" (listed under ""Sichuan Delicacies"" not ""Soup"", and very different from a typical Americanized Hot & Sour).  For non-spicy dishes, I would recommend the Scallion Pancake (the only Americanized appetizer I would recommend here),""Sichuan Cold Noodles - none spicy"" (cold noodles in a vinegary peanut sauce), ""Sichuan Style String Beans"" (a Sichuan classic, and done very well here), ""Meat Ball Sichuan Style"" (A soup-like hot pot with huge meatballs and lots of vegetables), and the Sesame Sweet Potato Cakes (A hot soft sweet-potato pancake that is stuffed with a sweet bean paste, coated in sesame seeds, and drizzled with a sweet sauce).  This restaurant also has fancier locations in Framingham and Brookline, but the food is much better in Billerica. If you're looking for authentic or spicy food, it's worth the drive

I want good Japanese ramen spots,"Name: Tora Ramen; Review: Amazing ramen! Had a chance to taste good tonkatsu ramen after a long time. I had the kuro tonkatsu ramen which is very good . Probably better than all ramen places I have tried in Boston. The spicy miso ramen was very good too as told by my partner. Something I had never tried before was torched pork belly that came with the ramen and it was melt in mouth. we also ordered a side of kuro karaage which was very crunchy yet moist . Cash only and they accept tips with it
Name: Sushiemon; Review: I am an expert of Japanese cuisine and I have to say like it or not Sushiemon is the most authentic Japanese Sushi restaurant in the Back Bay area.  The food might look simple and it might even taste bland to some of us Americans, but that is what real Japanese food is. It is about retaining the original taste of natural ingredients. It is philosophical and full of intricacies. They treat every plate of food like a piece of art. If you pay attention to the chef's sushi plating, you will notice every plate is nuanced by the level of detail Japanese culture calls for.  Before you decide you are going to rate it 3 stars, please consider the chef is trying to serve us the most authentic Japanese food, not Americanized Japanese food. It is very hard to find another restaurant like this in the Back Bay area, let's show him some support shall we
Name: Tao Ramen•Sushi; Review: First time here and I’m definitely coming back. I moved here from Boston and this place is one of the best ramen place I’ve seen so far. Now I don’t have to drive to Boston to get my ramen fix
Name: Tora Ramen; Review: I was here for the soft opening and was pleasantly surprised. I got the shiro ramen with double chashu ramen that was cooked perfectly via the sous vide. Very yummy broth and one of the best soft boiled eggs I’ve had in a long time. Totto ramen comes in a close second. You’ll find me here more often as I plan to try all the different kinds of ramen they offer
Name: Santouka Back Bay; Review: This is a solid Ramen spot that will not disappoint. I stood in line with many others for ~40 min on a cold winter day, and would have happily done it again. There is nothing like sitting down with a piping hot bowl of Ramen on a cold day.  I went with their signature Tonkotsu Shio Ramen, and paired it with their combo deal which is a total no-brainer. For only a few bucks extra the Ramen came with a rice bowl (Cha-Shu Gohan) and a soft boiled egg (Aji-Tama) on the side. I thought the broth of the Ramen was complex and oh so delicious. Personally, I thought the meat in the soup was too fatty which was a distraction from the otherwise great bowl of Ramen. The side dishes were flavorful and paired perfectly with my steaming hot bowl of soup.  This restaurant is pretty small, so if you plan to head this way you better be prepared to wait. That being said, the chefs move quickly and all patrons have food in front of them pretty quickly which really helps the line outdoors to move along. Santouka's location in the Back Bay is a perfect place to take a pit-stop if you are doing some shopping on Newbury or at the Prudential. I'd happily recommend this spot to anyone looking for a good bowl of Ramen","Name: Amateras Ramen; Review: The only times I've gone here is at night. They have very fast, attentive, and polite service, but I have never been during a busy time.  The ramen is good. It reminds me of the ramen shops in Japan. Their Yokohama tonkotsu ramen isn't as creamy as the tonkotsu you'll get in a nice shop in Tokyo (what most people think of when they think tonkotsu), but I like it.  They have a few other types, including spicy miso with different levels of spiciness (on the ""specials"" menu).  The menu is very concise and simple. Each ramen type comes with basic toppings, and you can add in as many toppings as you like for an extra $1-$4 each. I like their varied selection of toppings.  I hope this place doesn't make me fat

Name: Oisa Ramen; Review: This is my third time here, and I gotta say there’s something about the “coziness” that I really enjoy. So far, loving the tonkotsu and the beef one (the nezi shoyu? Shabuyaki? sorry, I don’t remember the name). The truffle one was a little too “sweet” for me, but certainly a unique ramen... I’ve never had something quite like it!  Ok, so now let’s talk a little bit about the triangle of ramen classification . On the corners of this triangle are: modern, comfort, and experimental. In Boston, you can think of experimental as ‘Yume wo katare’. I’m not sure if there’s a modern one here, but if you’re a ramen fan you’ll know of Ippudo (there’s one in New York), which is a solid modern on the classification scale. And lastly there’s comfort. And you can think of comfort as a hearty bowl of ramen that’ll fill you up and keep you warm on a cold winter day.  This place sits real close to modern, with a slight bias towards comfort, and just a scooch towards experimental. What does this mean for you? I have no idea. Go try the ramen it’s delicious :
Name: Amateras Ramen; Review: First, most remarkable was how fast and efficient the service was during Friday lunch hour. Second, don't be put off by the construction outside, I walked past it once before I saw it the second time. Third, this is the first ramen I've tried outside of Chicago that has deighted me as much as my favorite ramen shops in Chi Town (obviously I've never been to Japan).  For the purpose of true comparison I kept it simple: Yokohama Tonkatsu and Pakchee Salad. The broth was rich and complex, just as it should be. The pork was tender. If I were to do it over I would have ordered some extra toppings. Size wise this was a little smaller than I'm used to but I still couldn't finish all the noodles. And the Cold Brew Iced Matcha Green Tea was a nice suprise as I ordered it without looking at the menu and thought I was just getting green tea. They served it with simple syrup on the side but I didn't need it
Name: Kappo Sushi and Ramen; Review: One of the top 5 best bowls of ramen I've had ever. The place is a little cramped, but the food came out delicious and quickly too.

Best Ramen for the money in New England imo. If you prefer light, their Shio and Yuzu Shio broth is refreshing and flavorful. The Miso and Spicy Miso are balanced and not overly heavy like some other Boston Ramen spots, and their Soy and Jigoku (my personal favorite) keep me coming back every time.  Show me another place that can deliver the same quality (and quantity) for under ten bucks and I'll be very surprised. Their side dishes are all winners. Try a different one every time - you won't be disappointed. I lived 5 minutes from the Allston location, but I will gladly commute to the new Medford location for this stuff. So glad they're back!!  Side note: Kaidama (second helping of noodles) is a thing here, which only some spots in Japan and very few in America do. Just sayin'

Name: Wen's noodle and Ramen 过桥米线; Review: Contrary to prior reviews, the service was excellent. Also, the tip wasn't added when I used my card until I added it, so I don't know what that review was about. It seemed pretty authentic to me. I had the tonkatsu ramen with a few add-ons. I was disappointed there wasn't a spicy option, but there were three spicy condiments on the table that helped me make it spicy. It's not my favorite ramen place in Boston, but I'm glad I visited

Name: Kappo Sushi and Ramen; Review: Tried their sushi burrito. Very fresh ingredients with salmon, tuna, tobiko eggs, and a mixed slaw that all worked very well together. Miso soup was delicious as well! Will be back to try out their ramen. Side note: this place is being run by the same people behind Ebi Sushi (Union Sq) and Hokkaido Ramen (Central Sq), so you can have high expectations for food quality

Name: Pikaichi; Review: Wow! What a nice surprise to have a Ramen shop just down the street from my work place! And even more, it's Pikaichi!!! I have visited it's previous Allston Super 88 location before a few times, and was sad that it had closed. I was also sad that my favorite Burrito place that used to be here closed recently, wondering what would come here next. Then one day, I noticed the familiar ""Lightning bolt"" Pikaichi sign in the window of this location. Really?! And finally this week, it has opened, and the wait is over! Hurray! Came to check things out on lunch today. Nice & clean, obviously brand new interior, of a familiar location to me. Seats were mostly full, but the wait time should be short. Ordered Pikaichi Miso Ramen. The Ramen noodles were my favorite thick 'Futo-men', and nicely cooked chewy. Miso base soup/broth was VERY tasty as well. A few slices of very tender and also tasty Chashu pork, and corn on the top. You can also add many different topping as well, if you like. I need to come here again to try out all the other flavors. Congratulations on re-opening here in West Medford! I will definitely be back for more"
French cuisine nearby,"Name: The Hungry I; Review: For anniversary we wanted French cuisine we thought this place would be romantic and although it does have a romantic atmosphere the entry way to get into the actual restaurant is not well marked and you walk through an alleyway very small restaurant but we ate on the terrorist we should have known something was up when we walked in and it had been open for 40 minutes and no one was there the waiter was nice but the food was mot French cuisine as expected maybe a few items but mostly American food extremely limited menu extremely overpriced I wanted French cuisine something that I couldn't make at home everything we ate I could have made at home place is overrated and overpriced will not returne
Name: Bar Lyon; Review: Overall this restaurant had outstanding French comfort food.I had the burger which was probably one of the best burgers I've had in the last 5 years I normally don't get a burger for dinner but I figured I'd give it a shot and it was boy it was good! Prices were not really cheap it was a moderately priced restaurant. Definitely was hopping when we were there.we plan to go there again soon not sure exactly what I mean it's a fair distance from where we live but it's worth the drive. If you do like true French cuisine I would highly recommend the cassoulet. Overall there's nothing on the restaurant menu that I actually could not recommend. We're big when it comes to French food and I would say everything on there was a winner
Name: Grand Tour; Review: We were excited to try this new place but it was unfortunately very disappointing. I’m French and have lived most of my life in France and the food at Grand Tour is not even close to French food sadly... First, it is incredibly overpriced. To give a few examples, the Jambon de Paris was 3-4 slices of thin ham (not Parisian ham at all by the way) at $10. The cheese plate was a selection of 3 New England cheeses (not even French ones) and the 3 pieces were paper thin at $24. We also had the Foie Gras which was tasteless at $22. Tip is also included at 20% for a party of any size (we were just 2 people) which we thought was unusual for Boston. The service was good though. Overall, not a French experience at all. Just a pretentious overpriced restaurant...it was deeply disappointing
Name: Aura; Review: At the moment  you step in that restaurant  the stuff gives you a good feeling. Very comfortable waiters, it is a good restaurant to go out with buddies or with your date. enjoyable  cuisine, skillful  chef de cuisine, comfortable  cost and courteous  service. Warmly recommended
Name: Ma Maison; Review: It seems to me that nearly every facet of this restaurant is perfect. 1st they start by bringing fresh French bread to the table with salted cultured French butter.The drink menu is exquisite and the espresso is to die for. With a friend of mine for lunch we ordered the French toast with blueberries, the rattatouille, the him and brie sandwich, and spinach and goat cheese omelet. The French toast is the best that I have had anywhere to date. I have a very sensitive palate and can tell that the bread is soaked in a mixture much like one that would be used for  creme brulee, cooked perfectly, served with fresh blueberries rolled in cream and real maple syrup. The omelette was savory, and tender without being over or undercooked. My companion tells me that the rattatouille was delightful and we shared the ham sandwich later on that afternoon and it was quite delightful and a handy lunch on the go for 2 travelers. The prices might seem a bit high at 1st but are actually quite reasonable for the quality of the food and service. It was a bit warm in the restaurant but seeing that it was over 70ﾟ out that is to be expected. And as soon as I brought that to the attention of the staff they turned on a small air conditioner that was nearby to rectify the situation. I have traveled to this cafe before as it is right by mass general hospital and I see it as a ray of light in an otherwise dismal culinary world","Name: Frenchie Wine Bistro; Review: To kick off our dinner, we shared some « escargots », some « coq au vin », and what I consider to be the best Tuna Tartare in town. Everything was so good that we asked for extra bread to finish all the sauce, but please don’t repeat that... But it wasn’t until the traditional « steak frites » cooked medium rare and the home made french fries, which is such a typical french meal, and which was soooo good, that I trully felt like in one of the best French brasserie in Paris. And I’m not done yet... I won’t even get started with the wine and cheese list, because I could write 2000 words only about it and how I almost had tears of joy because of it, but I’d say this: The olive oil cake we had as a dessert is simply the best dessert I had in a very long time, and makes it worth it by itself to put Frenchie on top of your to-dos when you come to Boston. LOVED IT
Name: Petit Robert Bistro; Review: I came here on a date after I mentioned that I had never really had quality French food before. My date made a reservation and it wasn't too busy for 6:30pm on a Thursday night, but we were seated right away. We had the option to sit outside or inside, and we chose to sit outside since it was a nice day and the neighborhood seemed quiet. We ordered the escargots and half a dozen oysters to start, and they were both absolutely delicious. The escargots were flavorful, and the oysters were extremely refreshing. For our entrees, I ordered the scallops and my date ordered the pork. The pork looked like it was breaded, which surprised my date, since he was here last year and it was prepared differently then. It was still tasty, but maybe a tad overcooked. The scallops were cooked perfectly though so I had no complaints! I took off one star for the service since it wasn't the quickest. Overall, I wouldn't mind coming back
Name: French Quarter; Review: Went down to this new restaurant on Washington Street in downtown crossing and what a pleasant surprise.  The decor, lighting, food and service were all top notch.  The drink menu was right off a little bistro near Bourbon Street and the food was perfectly spiced and flavored (with a majority of the menu able to be served gluten free).  The staff was courteous, knowledgable and very friendly.  All in all a great night and cannot wait to go back and try some more things (oyster and liver apps and fried chicken dinner were amazing

Name: Bar Lyon; Review: What a wonderful restaurant. We had delicious appetizers; some oysters, steak tartare, the raclette and the duck confit (we were a party of 6) and as main we had the coq ai vin with pasta and the steak tartare with fries. Personally I would not serve the coq au bon with pasta. As dessert we shared the tart tatin and the choc mousse  And if weren’t for the desserts I would have given it 5 stars The tart tatin was “petit” and odd. The chocolate mousse had a dump load of salt on it that made it unbearable(apparently this was part of the description I had stopped reading at chocolate) After our feedback they kindly provided a new one without the salt.

Name: Bar Lyon; Review: DINNER REVIEW  One of the most memorable meals I've had in Boston in my 1.5 years here. Maybe it was because it was Valentine's Day but Bar Lyon took care of us and we will definitely be back.  This restaurant brought me back to my home stay in France with the rich flavors and the general layout of the restaurant. It's a small place and the majority of seating runs through the middle of the restaurant with 2-tops facing each other. It makes you feel like you are in a small Parisian bistro. The lighting is dim which makes it perfect for a romantic meal or a meal with close friends.  FOOD: I don't know who is back there churning butter but that's some of the best bread and butter I've had in a while. No surprise this place is French.  For the two of us, we ordered the below: French Onion Soup - I admittedly am not a fan of any French Onion soup but my girlfriend loved it and 100% recommends it Duck Confit - I got this as an appetizer and it's probably my favorite thing we got. Fall-off-the-bone duck with delicious garlic butter and Lyonnaise Potatoes Le Burger - I had heard about this burger so I, of course, had to order it. With Pork Belly and a Farm Egg on there, you already know this thing is going to be rich. It definitely was and the fries that came with it were those delicious matchstick fries. Bavette Steak au Poivre - that Cognac and Green Peppercorn sauce...WOW! Steak is perfectly cooked too.  Here's what I would recommend...the burger was delicious but right after the duck confit, it was a little much. I would recommend getting something a bit lighter along with the burger like the market greens with vinaigrette or oysters. The acidity will counteract all the richness.  Can't wait to go back

Name: La Voile; Review: The idea to bring La Voile to Boston came about by a Swiss-American named Pierre, a reporter-photographer, also a sailor by choice & owner of a superbe sailing yacht moored directly across from the restaurant. He soon became a regular customer and a good friend. Over time & many glasses of wine, the plan to open a restaurant in Boston together was hatched. Everything was brought over… the zinc bar, the tables and chairs, the wooden wine fridge (an old Butcher’s fridge), the marble console, the vintage chandeliers, sailing pictures, the entrance door… even the staff! you can admire on the walls the unique and private collection of Pierre work, From Dali to Steve McQueen, through Catherine Deneuve and Hubert Beuve-Méry. The Cuisine is evidently French and authentic, with some “Méridional” dishes like the “Soupe de Poisson” (Fish Soup) or the Loup de Mer (Seabass) imported fresh from the Mediterranean. These dishes will surely conjure up memories of your last trip to the South of France or Paris. The Chef, Raphael,  prepares all les ‘incontournables’ of french regions (Rillettes du Mans, Escargots de Bourgogne, Magret de Canard…","Name: Marliave; Review: I visited the Marliave recently while visiting my family in Boston. The ambiance is pretty cool when you first come in the smell of fresh bread baking welcomes you.  We started by ordering some drinks our choices were all to our likings, the Capezzana wine was delightful and perfect pairing for our meal.  The raw bar was excellent a great choice of fresh oysters and clams were served and they offer daily for a dollar each.   The highlight of the appetizer menu for me was the escargot, it was buttery and cooked to perfection to me a pleasant surprise since the best escargot I had was at L’Escargot Montorgeil In Paris and this is similar if not better. The mac and cheese was creamy and delicious a must have! The selection for appetizers and charcuterie offers many options.  For the entrée we ordered the ravioli with the Sunday gravy sauce which was really good. The fish and chips were crispy and had good flavor. The rabbit was the best plate we ordered perfectly paired with mashed potatoes it was very enjoyable. The only dish that I would not recommend was the steak frites while the flavor was good the steak was tough to chew and rubbery; our waiter was prompt to offer something else when brought to his attention. The prices are a bit higher than I expected.  Overall I would recommend this restaurant. The menu has a great variety of items for all tastes , the ambiance is incredible and our waiter Daniel was the best. He was friendly, professional, and was prompt to all our needs. I would definitely go back

Name: Ma Maison; Review: I have never eaten french food before, this is my first time. So I can't really compare or say if it's really authentic french food. I also come from Italy so I know the value and taste of good food from europe. I can say this was one of my best food experiences in Boston. I liked every dish I tried, like the escargots, coq au vin, crepes, fois gras and the creme brulee as the dessert. Everything was very testy, delicate and also nice to look at. I had some sauvignon blanc in carafe as wine and it also was very good. I liked that they bring you the baguette bread as much as you ask and it comes warm as freshly baked with some butter. The dishes have a lot of sauces, especially the escargots, so it is a shame to waste all that goodness without doing ""scarpetta"" with the bread. The waiters also were very nice and always ready to help us.  Overall I had a very good experience, I liked the food and I felt good during my stay there. Good job to everyone, I will definitely come again to try more french cuisine!! :"

Their traditional take on pork gukbap (Pork broth, meat and rice soup) and Jjajangmyun (one of the most popular noodle dish in South Korea) along with speacialty dishes you can’t find anywhere else in Boston make them one of the most authentic Korean restaurants in all of Boston. Their broth dishes will literally melt your soul away during the cold Beantown winters and give you a health boost after having this dish. I am a foodie myself and proud to be a Korean American who have been living in both worlds for a good amount of time in my 29 years of age and I must say that Seoul Jangteo has truly made me happy knowing that I can get authentic traditional korean dishes in Boston. Five stars all the way and recommend this restaurant to all food lovers. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ 🍛🍲🍜🍚🍶
Name: Grassroots Cafe; Review: Working in the building, I walked past Grassroots literally thousands of times before I finally tried it.  And when I finally did, I realized I had been missing out.  It's a very, very small nook on the outside wall of a building, specializing in Korean food.  They have some standard lunch sandwiches, but the reason to go to Grassroots is for their Korean Fusion menu board.  The east west pig sandwich comes with a few big pieces of slow cooked pork covered in a spicy Asian sauce, complimented with onions, cheese, tomato, and lettuce.  Even prepared as ""mild"", it's spicy, so beware.  The vegetables cool down the spiciness and savoriness of the pork, the cheese gives it a creamy layer of texture, and the big bulkie roll holds it all together.   The roll never gets soggy.  The KBM (Korean Bahn Mi) is an excellent take on the Vietnamese classic, with a Korean twist.  It has all the usual suspects of a good bahn mi, but the meat is slathered in a tasty Korean BBQ sauce.  The bread is softer than I prefer in a bahn mi, but it didn't detract from the taste and it didn't get soggy.  The staff is always welcoming, polite, and fast.  Prices are just barely of the higher end, but it's worth it
Name: The Smoke Shop BBQ - Seaport; Review: Great restaurant in multiple regards. The BBQ itself is flavorful and good. It's hard to find good BBQ in Boston, and while I'm sure this isn't the same as the pit bosses make in the south, it definitely holds its own! I like the way they do their flavors. I know there are many styles but I prefer mine more smokey with a spice kick and a hint of sweet. I don't care as much for the very sweet BBQ sauces. They do their BBQ the way I like it, with just the right amount of a little kick that wont knock you over, so don't worry if you don't like spicy. I got the burned ends dish and it was very flavorful. It comes with a choice of 2 sides. The mac n cheese could've been creamier but that's my one little ""complaint"" as far as food quality goes. I don't know much about whiskey, but if you like whiskey they have a lot to choose from. The dishes are expensive for what you get, which is to be expected of BBQ but the portions were a bit on the small side, but still satisfying. The staff was GREAT. They did what they could to get a table ready for me and my wife. I never felt rushed with the order even though they were busy and the waiter answered all my questions and was polite. They even gave us a free cocktail that they accidentally made for someone else! Parking is difficult and not recommended but if money isn't an issue you'll find garages. The easiest way to get here is to take the T to South Station, walk over the bridge to the seaport district and head north one block to Congress street. Only about 1/2 mile walk. I recommend the Smoke Shop BBQ
Name: Korean Garden; Review: Pretty great.  Not quite as good as Koreana in Cambridge, but more authentic and more casual.  The prices are a little steep, but that's typical.  I like the variety they offer.  Good pajeon (Korean savory pancakes).  They serve Gaeranjjim which is pretty rare in America, but all over the place in Korea.  It's a sort of fluffed egg soup/souffle.  It's hard to explain.  Worth a try.  The Sam Gyeop Sal is good.  This is a good place to go if you're new to Korean BBQ.  And it's certainly authentic","Name: Korean Garden; Review: Pretty great.  Not quite as good as Koreana in Cambridge, but more authentic and more casual.

Name: SOJUba; Review: I heard a Korean restaurant opened near my school so my friends and I went to try it over the weekend. The place is really nice, and quite big for a Korean restaurant. We were fourth in line on the waiting list, and the host took us to the bar area right away to get our night started. The bar area is just as chill, so we told ourselves that we would just eat at the bar if tables didn’t open up in the next 30 min. 25 minutes or so, a table opened up downstairs, and we ordered pretty much everything on the menu. Their original chicken was to die for, and the boodae pot was really really good too. It had a lively vibe with people enjoying themselves everywhere around me. We didn’t mean to go out drinking, but the scene def called for it! Four bottles of soju in, we asked for requests to the DJ and stayed until closing. The servers are super fun and friendly, and the owner came to check on us in the middle of our meal. This is a new gem for me and my friends for sure! I’m glad we don’t need to hike to Allston now to enjoy soju with authentic Korean food
Name: Seoul Restaurant; Review: Amazing — truly authentic, tasty, reasonably priced/affordable, and worth every penny.  I’ve been ordering from Seoul for about half a year now and I’m so glad I found this gem in Boston! Owned and ran by a Korean family, you can taste the authenticity in every bite at Seoul. I’ve never been disappointed with their food... I’m only disappointed when all the food has gone to my tummy...  Their SPICY KALBI JJIM (steamed marinated beef) is my go-to. I’ve been hooked on it and am now addicted to it, as I must have it at least 1-2 times a month. You can choose the spicy levels and the most spicy (level 4) level is about the same as buldak bokkeum noodles (Korean spicy chicken noodles). The kalbi jjim is soft and marinated perfectly. It’s a must-have***. Please try it!  I hope Seoul continues their business with great quality and price! I am truly thankful for them providing such authentic Korean food, which seems to be rare in Boston. :) A real gem!
Name: Seoul Jangteo; Review: Been on my bucket list for about a month now and finally paid a visit! Cute little place, very friendly staff and a good range of items on the menu, also very reasonably priced. We ordered the fritters and bibimbap. I believe the most popular item there was their soup but since I already had my eye on the spicy black bean noodles with pork, I decided to stick to it! They were all brilliant! Although I wish there was a little more pork than onions in my dish, it was still extremely good and worth the price I was paying! A must visit if you want to have Korean food-on a budget or not! $40 for all of this, I’m definitely coming back
Name: Suishaya; Review: Friends of mine took me once to this place, with Korean and Japanese styles dishes, inside Chinatown hood.  If you look for a fork, knife or spoon, don't look for them, it's supposed to use your provided chopsticks and in case you order something that it's mandary in order to help eating it, they will be provided.  This was my first Korean restaurant in the US, so I declined their Sushi section in the menu and I headed to the Korean dishes.  First of all, you'll get some apetizers as red beans, bean spouts, carrot with chilli.  First time I tried Okdol Bibimbap, it came in a really hot pan, with all the ingredients ready to be cooked in it and a small recipient with spicy sauce. You have to be fast and start mixing it to don't get your food burnt. I ordered it with spicy pork, so it was spicy and very hot, it took me more than half hour to finish it, the amount of food also was big tho. My experience was food, the food, service and the local were good.  The second time I had Jam Bang with Korean noodle, also a big bowl came to the table, with the usual thick Korean noddles, mussels, shrimps and a selection of vegetables. As it was raining it was the perfect choice, it was both hot and spicy. The noodles and the soup were tasty and flavourful, I usually don't eat soup but this one it was really worth it.  As I came with some friends both times I tried Bulgogi Beef, that was pretty good.  The only bad things is they don't have beer nor home made tea, so don't expect anything good for drink.  The second time the fire alarm was triggered as some dishes are really hot and smoke comes out of them, but it's a mere anecdote","Name: Korean Garden; Review: Pretty great.

Name: Kaju Korean Cuisine — Kenmore; Review: Came here for dinner. Pretty straight forward decor inside. No wait on a weekend dinner time. I tried the clay pot bulgogi. Which was a bunch of meat and rice underneath. It tasted ok nothing amazing. I added a lot of their hot sauce to bring some flavor and it was better. My friend tried the tofu soup. They asked for it extra spicy and it felt like medium spicy if you are into spicy food. Tasted like regular tofu soup too. Overall it was average Korean food. Would try if you are in area and looking for Korean but I'm sure better elsewher

Name: Korean Asian Kitchen Boston; Review: I’m writing this review mostly because I was swayed by their 5 star rating on Google. After eating their food, I don’t think they deserve that, and I don’t want others to be similarly disappointed. I’m suspicious all other current Google reviews of this restaurant may be fake because they are so vague that they could describe any restaurant. So, I want to provide a review I know is non-fake.  The tofu soup was good and full of vegetables. The bibimbap consisted mostly of rice, and was maybe the worst I have had. The dumplings were generic, but alright. It wasn’t terrible, but I thought the food was worse than what you would find at most other Korean restaurants. It’s ok in a pinch but there are a lot of great Korean restaurants in the Boston area so I’d recommend ordering elsewhere!  As a disclaimer, I ordered Uber Eats from this location but never visited their physical location, if they have one

Name: Misono Grill; Review: I've been coming to this restaurant in the ""Asian food court at the 88 (the name of the previous Asian grocery store which is now the Hong Kong Supermarket)"" for decades.  It's one of a number of small restaurants in the food stall complex, toward the back, close to to the supermarket and the connecting doors (which always open as if holding back a 100mph tornado lol).  The food here is mostly Korean and really excellent, with prices in the $8-$13 or so range.  The bibimbap stone bowls are fantastic, especially the remaining crispy, crunchy, baked rice at the bottom sides of the super hot bowl (retains heat like crazy, totally fantastic on a cold winter's night!).  Highly recommended for a quick meal at affordable prices, and a total genuine feeling of the food stalls in Asia"
Seafood restaurants in the area,"Name: Galo Rei; Review: I've been going here since they first opened and it has been on our takeout restaurant rotation ever since! It's an easy go to when trying to cater to a larger group of people without having to settle for pizza everytime.They also hands down have the best chicken of its kind too! (Def order it Spicy for an extra kick) If seafood is your thing, the owner Sandra makes a killer Seafood rice that is heaping full of seafood for under $20!! Easily feeds two adults or more, as is the case with most of their entrees! Add this to your must try restaurants and you'll easily become a regular....oh and its CASH ONLY so be prepared
Name: Dry Dock Cafe; Review: I was so pleasantly surprised, I thought this was going to be just  an ok experience but I walked into Drydock Cafe and the white tablecloths and flowers on every table was a great first impression. The focus of the menu is on seafood but they do have a couple of chicken dishes. The seafood was really fresh, I recommend the grilled seafood platter that included fish, shrimp, and scallops- all delicious. You get to choose 2 sides. They have a wine and beer menu. All prices were very reasonable and the service was very good. I recommend this little known restaurant
Name: Boston fried chicken; Review: Wasn’t the worse but just was not good! If your use to the NY fried chicken restaurants in the Boston area, you will not like this place. Food was cold and tasteless. Wish they were better because theres no other chicken place in the area, unless you go the next city over
Name: Pete's Dockside; Review: We stayed at the waterfront area for PAX weekend.  This was my second year going to PAX.  Similar to what I noticed last year, the options for food were not as great by the waterfront as it is in the center of the city.  A quick google search showed us Pete's Dockside rated high, two dollar signs, and walking distance from the Westin hotel (about a 11 minute walk).  At first, from the outside, the place is hard to notice as it is conjoined with a truck warehouse.  But inside is a small  order and sit area, which seats about 15 people.  Based on description, they've been serving fried seafood for years.  I ordered the Seafood Combo, which was a platter of the seasons fried seafood.  My order came with fried haddock, shrimp, and scallops.  The seafood tasted as fresh as implied in the ""dockside"" of the location's name  We also ordered the soup of the day, Fish Chowder.  I had never had fish chowder before, and was a little skeptic, but the fish chowder was just as good or better than any clam chowder I have had to date
Name: Select Oyster Bar; Review: I recently had lunch for 6 people here and their seafood was absolutely fantastic. Everything we ordered was flavorful and fresh. We made reservations prior to coming, and when we walked in the hostess was warm and welcoming. The decor is beautiful, with exposed brick walls and unique artwork displayed throughout the restaurant. The restaurant somehow manages to pull off a sophisticated yet casual vibe. The ambiance is one of my favorite parts of the restaurants. It's upscale but cozy at the same time (hard to pull off!).I recently had lunch for 6 people here and their seafood was absolutely fantastic. Everything we ordered was flavorful and fresh.

Also they have a huge wine list, I tried the Napa Pinot Noir. I'm surprised to see some people complaining about the prices, considering it's a select seafood restaurant in the Back Bay. Overall, I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking to try a new seafood restaurant in Boston","Name: Legal Sea Foods - Downtown Crossing; Review: I've been here a few times now and have sat at the bar every time. I have been something of a Legal Seafoods Hater for some time but their newest location might have changed my mind on the brand. The bar is sleek and modern and makes for the perfect stop for any kind of pre-theater district activities. the cocktail menu is good, I've had a Tiki drink and their Sangria, both I would order again.  Crab Cakes - Fresh crab cakes that come with a hollandaise type sauce with fried pancetta which is almost like little bites of bacon  White Clam Pizza - Clams, white sauce, and arugula on flatbread. Oh and also little bits of fried pancetta... Is pancetta the new truffle oil? I'm not complaining, it was a must get item and at $11 bucks a bargain. It is perfect for 2 people to split while having some drinks  ""Everything"" Tuna Steak with Cauliflower Risotto - The concept is that it is coated the same as an everything bagel. For me, some salt and pepper would have been just fine. The tuna steak was fine but I've had better, more tender cuts elsewhere. The Cauliflower Risotto was flavorful and light. This dish would also be great for the health conscious
Name: Boston Seafood; Review: amazing food, hardworking and genuinely personable and accommodating staff, attentive and wonderful owner. i'm local, so i've lost count of how many times i've been here, and i've never had a bad experience. the broiled salmon is always perfectly cooked and super fresh, the lobster bisque is to die for, and the fish Reuben is amazing. my aunt loves the spaghetti and the fish and chips, and my uncle has fallen in love with the bbq ribs (by the way, he is 85 and devoured his prime rib the other night like a tiger)
Name: Legal Sea Foods - Downtown Crossing; Review: I don't have a problem with the legal seafood chain. My Boston bred boo has a predilection  for these restaurants so I've dined at several, and while they always seems a little expensive for what you get, the service and over all dining experience compensates.  That said, the Legal Crossing location is such an unholy mess it's hard to see how not survives in its prime downtown crossing location.  They kind of play hide the ball with the exact concept, alluding to a combination of influences, but it's essentially an Asian fusion restaurant where you can also get a cup of clam chowder. It's unclear why the menu is such a mess, but no one in our three person party enjoyed their meal.  I got hoison glazed salmon on a bed of mush. I couldn't believe how discombobulated the plate was.  Another diner got sashimi because it was heavily spiced, something not mentioned on the menu.  To it's credit, the service was professional and the opium den ambiance was amusing.  I would recommend you skip this location
Name: Legal Sea Foods - Harborside; Review: Quick summary: not worth the exorbitant prices for inconsistent quality but decor and great desserts make a great post dinner stop.  This place clearly attempts to make service a priority. Received top notch service from bartender and hostess, both went above and beyond most places. Waiter was communicative and eager to answer questions although there was some confusion about who our waiter actually was.  Ordered appetizers, two soups, which were both served from coffee type carafes, not even the same style oddly enough. Don't know where they were storing those as our soups were luke warm after being poured. Also the ingredients in my lobster soup were  cold so I ate luke warm soup with cold lobster bits. Flavors were OK but nothing above average.  Main dishes took a bit longer than expected for such a small dining room, maybe 30 mins after appetizers. Finally received a halibut and sea bass which were hit and miss. Halibut was quite good and unique. The sea bass had absolutely no flavor and the gnocchi bed underneath was just an odd combination.  Finished up with dessert which was exceptional. This is the second time we've been here for dessert and serious props go out to the dessert chef. Everything we've had for dessert has been excellent.  When you factor in that you are probably spending $75 a head the food is an absolute pass. For that kind of money everything should be flawless, temperature, presentation, flavor, etc. Too many inconsistencies detract from an otherwise decent experience. I say eat on the first floor and save some cash, then make your way up to the second for post dinner drinks and dessert
Name: New Jumbo Seafood Restaurant; Review: I was craving some authentic Chinese style seafood and decided on this place because it was closest to South Station. SOLID CHOICE. We got the black bean sauce clam and the garlic and vermicelli scallops, plus stir fried green beans for veg. The clams were excellent, scallops tasted just like the ones we would find in China, and the green beans were cooked beautifully - nice and crisp with a delicious minced meat base. Staff were your typical Chinese restaurant style, minimal involvement and will bring you whatever you need. We went during off hours so the food came to us quickly. A lady next to us got an entire platter of shrimp and was chowing down so I assume the other seafood dishes on their menu are also good","Name: New Jumbo Seafood Restaurant; Review: I was craving some authentic Chinese style seafood and decided on this place because it was closest to South Station.

Name: Fisherman's Net; Review: The only Gluten Free Clam Chowder in Quincy Market is served here as well as scallops wrapped in bacon.  The stuffies are tasty and a good choice for a quick seafood snack.  Clams, Fries, Scallops are all on the menu here - a good bunch of people work here.  The offer a good variety of sandwiches here.  Crabmeat, shrimp, fried calamari, fish rolls - New England Seafood is the them here

Name: Pescatore Restaurant; Review: It's a small neighborhood restaurant that specializes in Italian seafood (in case you couldn't tell by the name), but still has plenty of more 'land based' options. While probably the fanciest restaurant in the neighborhood, you don't really need to get dressed up for it. They also do take out, but do not do delivery. Good place for a quiet date, as long as you don't try to go during the rush on a holiday that typically sees a lot of dinner reservations

Name: Legal Sea Foods; Review: Myself and several of my friends went to the Legal Sea Food on Park Plaza. We were on a trip to Boston from Buffalo, and I suggested we eat at one of Legal's locations because of previous recommendations from family and because of my desire for local seafood. It was also very close to our hotel. I was not disappointed.  The place looked nice inside, somewhat more upscale than I had expected. Despite our large group, we were seated on a Friday night between 7 and 8 within 20 minutes.  Our waiter, Justin D., was very knowledgeable about both the drink and food menu, and gave a few of my friends some helpful recommendations and opinions upon ordering. He was very personable and friendly, and did a fantastic job throughout our stay despite the fact that we were somewhat underdressed, perhaps a bit loud, and that we stuck around much longer than we should have.  I had a Cisco Whale's Tale to drink, a cup of New England clam chowder to start, and fried New England clams for dinner. My friends had various things from chowder to bisque, fish and shellfish, and plenty of wine (most of which came as recommendations from our waiter). My friends seemed very satisfied (a few of them who were not accustomed to seafood spoke highly of what they tried), and frankly I was in heaven. It has been four days since we ate there and I'm already pining to go back and have more. Superb food, a decent selection of beer, and a very large selection of wine that varies in price.  Some of my party ordered dessert and appeared to enjoy it. I have little to say as I didn't have anything after dinner.  We requested separate checks when we first sat down, but there was some unfortunate mix-ups in a couple of the checks. Some items were switched around and one or two drinks mysteriously appeared out of nowhere. Justin did his best to rectify the problem, and after a while everyone was paying for exactly what they ordered, I believe.  I'd recommend this Legal location to anyone who finds themselves in downtown Boston who appreciates or would like to try good seafood, or for anyone who wants some good wine from a wide selection in a nice-looking restaurant and bar. It is very conveniently placed near several hotels","Name: Holly Crab; Review: One of the best restaurants in Boston I've been to in the past couple of years.  Eating in a restaurant isn't just about consuming food - it's the whole package: the ambiance, the people, the experience and of course, in the end, the food.  First, the food was amazing. I'm a huge seafood fan and can be selective when it comes to restaurants that specialize in seafood. Also, I'm generally reluctant to try new places because of my delicate tastebud, but the perfectly cooked crab, shells and shrimp forced me to devour without me recognizing how fast I was eating! The sauce was spicy but in a tasty way, and by the end of the meal, couldn't help but yell out, ""holly crab!!!"" (Despite how cheesy that sounds...)  Second, the experience itself was fun! As much as I first didn't like the idea of eating out of a plastic bag using my hands, the whole package was sufficient to keep me perfectly clean even though eating like this can get messy! I was pleasantly flabbergasted!! I think the set up they have created is a phenomenal and clever one, and family gatherings can be really fun with so much action involved in eating :)  Lastly, the staff were really nice!! I consider this to be really important, because we are receiving a form of ""service"" by going to restaurants. Even if a restaurant has amazing food, I cease to go after trying couple of times if I realize that the people do not have service-oriented minds. This place knew how to treat their customers right.  All in all, one of handful of places I would give five stars and even bother to write a review on in Boston. I'm originally from New York and always complain about the food here in Boston, but this will now be my go-to place whenever I'm craving seafood or if friends visit the city! :

Name: Select Oyster Bar; Review: I recently had lunch for 6 people here and their seafood was absolutely fantastic. Everything we ordered was flavorful and fresh. We made reservations prior to coming, and when we walked in the hostess was warm and welcoming. The decor is beautiful, with exposed brick walls and unique artwork displayed throughout the restaurant. The restaurant somehow manages to pull off a sophisticated yet casual vibe. The ambiance is one of my favorite parts of the restaurants. It's upscale but cozy at the same time (hard to pull off!).I recently had lunch for 6 people here and their seafood was absolutely fantastic. Everything we ordered was flavorful and fresh.

The ambiance is one of my favorite parts of the restaurants. It's upscale but cozy at the same time (hard to pull off!). We ordered the Octopus appetizers, local oysters, Artic char, Bouillabaisse, lobster salad, and Salmon Crudo. The quality and freshness to their seafood is astounding. Also they have a huge wine list, I tried the Napa Pinot Noir. I'm surprised to see some people complaining about the prices, considering it's a select seafood restaurant in the Back Bay. Overall, I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking to try a new seafood restaurant in Boston

Name: Pete's Dockside; Review: We stayed at the waterfront area for PAX weekend.  This was my second year going to PAX.  Similar to what I noticed last year, the options for food were not as great by the waterfront as it is in the center of the city.  A quick google search showed us Pete's Dockside rated high, two dollar signs, and walking distance from the Westin hotel (about a 11 minute walk).  At first, from the outside, the place is hard to notice as it is conjoined with a truck warehouse.  But inside is a small  order and sit area, which seats about 15 people.  Based on description, they've been serving fried seafood for years.  I ordered the Seafood Combo, which was a platter of the seasons fried seafood.  My order came with fried haddock, shrimp, and scallops.  The seafood tasted as fresh as implied in the ""dockside"" of the location's name  We also ordered the soup of the day, Fish Chowder.  I had never had fish chowder before, and was a little skeptic, but the fish chowder was just as good or better than any clam chowder I have had to date

Name: Boston Sail Loft; Review: After reading the rave reviews, we decided to make this one of our stops during our visit to Boston. We ended up here late on Sunday night, about 830pm. Luckily, despite all the warnings to the contrary, we were seated immediately. The interior is small,  quaint, and casual, with a nice view of the wharf outside. My husband and I weren't starving but decided to order a cup of the clam chowder since people seemed to love it. We found it to be... okay. To be fair, neither of us are clam chowder connoisseurs, and this was my first. It tastes like creamy potato soup, but add clams and dill.  My husband ordered a whole lobster and side salad. He said it was tasty and we'll prepared. He enjoyed his dish. I ordered the seafood portofino, a linguini dish with lobster, scallops, and shrimp. I found the the seafood tough, overcooked. The wine garlic sauce was very tangy. I didn't quite finish it. The portions were very large l, thought, which is tough to find. The service was ok. The waiter didn't bring utensils so we had to go find some. He also forgot our waters, so we had to wait for him to return to get those. Not horrible offenses. Overall, it was an okay experience. With our meals and two alcohol beverages each, our bill was $116. Not terrible, but if I return, it would probably be to try the lobster Mac n cheese or fish and chips as a lunch option

Name: Legal Test Kitchen; Review: Their menu is fantastic! I have been here several times and always impressed by their dishes. The clam chowder is a classic! I would recommend getting at least a cup of it along with your meal - you don't want to miss out! I've had the crab and shrimp etouffee which was very flavorful and had a generous amount of shrimp in it. The crab is tossed on top. The blackened raw tuna sashimi was very fresh and came with a small side of seaweed salad. There was not too much sauce on it, which I appreciated. Great flavor from the seasoning on the sides.  Service was good and the waitresses are very attentive during the times I've visited. A popular place when there's conventions going on in the area - so lunch time it's usually full with people.  Highly suggest trying this out if you're around seaport"
Is there Greek food around here,"Name: Bhop - Boston House of Pizza; Review: I try to get here once or twice a week.  It's a short walk from the office.  They have a good style that's sort of Greek but sort of New York style pizza. They have avoided the greasy Greek model.  They also keep a variety of interesting pizza types ready to serve through the lunch rush.  Good stuff
Name: Doretta Taverna & Raw Bar; Review: Obviously greeks are the harshest critics of greek food especially when it's being done by non-greeks and my hats off to the chefs here .  My barometer for good greek is octopus---and the dish is perfection.  So well balanced with acidity on point--the lemon emulsion was texture heaven--almost a foam.  Speaking of heaven, ""getting the chicken"" is always the boring bet for restaurant-goers and here I would highly recommend it.  Greek food is simple and not remotely complex.  It's all about highlighting good ingredients and these guys nailed it.  My server Randy I want to bring with me on every dining experience.  He knew the menu inside out --where everything was sourced ---and wasn't rattled by a single question.  Cheers
Name: Hidyan Cafe; Review: The lifelong Bostonian cabbie instructed me to come here, and I am happy I did.  For those who like Greek style pizza (I grew up in a small town, eating nothing but Greek), their Vegetarian  pizza is out of this world amazing. New London Style Pizza in Acton is the gold standard in the world of Greek pizzas (in my opinion).  Hidyan Cafe's vegetarian pizza is equal to the gold standard.  The frozen yoghurt is excellent.  The chocolate cake was a mistake.  With pizza and frozen yoghurt in mind, I'll be coming back
Name: Skewers Wood Grill; Review: I have been to Skewers about 3/4 times now and wanted to write them a review because they deserve the praise.  During a pandemic where takeout is everything Skewers and the staff are top notch. The establishment is safe for picking up takeout, it’s very clean, and the staff is so respectful.  Now on to the food, my wife and I went to Greece a few years back and we fell in love with the food. Other than going back there, we searched for a few years for some ethnic Greek food that could hold it own. We went to a lot of great places but when Skewers opened and my friend said you have to try it. I thought “I’ll give it a shot”.  I’m grateful my friend recommended it, grateful for Skewers for moving into this area because it is outstanding. Best Greek food I have had since leaving Greece. The beautiful part of this place...it not just Greek food, they have other food that is also amazing (burgers, different bowls- all delicious)  My favorites are the lamb, chicken, beef skewers are amazing, the spicy feta has an amazing kick and so flavorful. We got the seasonal Watermelon, feta salad- a must try when they have it. The gyros with the Greek fries- a huge hit in this household.  I’d give 10 stars if I could, listen I don’t post reviews, in fact this is my first. I feel that during these hard times and seeing that Skewers is trying to open a restaurant for takeout and bring a little joy to people with their wonderful comfort of food, that deserves my respect and my review.  Show them some love you won’t be disappointed. I recommend and fully support this place.  Well done Skewers
Name: Mama's Place; Review: I found Mama's Place to be very much subpar, and as a Greek myself it pains me to say this. I love my country's food, but unfortunately Mama's Place did it a disservice, which could very well be explained by the lack of Greek chefs. I appreciated the decor, which was minimal, but it reminded me of my yiayia's house (grandma's house) so I liked it. However, I found it to be in an out-of-the-way location and despite its good reviews online I was unimpressed.The spanikopita tasted vaguely of onions, which it really should not (or else the menu should at least state the ingredients), and the rizogalo wasn't sweet or thick enough for my taste. The gyro was all right, but even though I had been craving Greek food for a while I still found myself thinking that ""this wasn't worth it"" - so, while the food wasn't horrible I still am giving it 2 stars for failing to meet my expectations. There are hopefully other places around the Boston area that can satisfy my standards after being exposed to yiayia's cooking. All in all, it's not horrible, but I believe that with some minor adjustments in recipes, customer information, and chef quality/authenticity, Mama's Place can truly become a gem in the Boston area","Name: Saloniki Greek; Review: Just tried Saloniki for the first time and I am very happy that it's a part of the Fenway community! I got their Herc pita, while my friend got the Niko pita. We split a lemon curd on the side as well.  The Herc's feta spread had the perfect amount of spice. The fresh vegetables complimented the honey pork very well. I think the best part might have been the crunch of the Greek fries (similar to slimmer potato wedges). There's nothing like a freshly made pita either.  The lemon curd mixed really well with the yogurt base. I only had a few bites and still found it to be quite decadent and filling. I'm particular about greek yogurt too, but this kind was top notch.  I can't wait to go back
Name: Saloniki Greek; Review: Authentic greek fast food - delicious and a great price! They do things right - great tzatziki, fresh tomatoes, real feta cheese, warm pita bread, and the works. I love their zucchini fritter bowl (with a pita on the side). The only complaint I have: one sauce is not enough! It's hard to appreciate the flavors of this place (the sauces are were it really comes out) without trying more than one to give some flavor to your meal. Go ahead and ask for more than one - you won't regret it! Saloniki - please consider giving 2 sauce options or making them larger portions
Name: Zo Greek Cuisine; Review: Zo is one of my two go-to places for gyros.  Both of their brick-and-mortar locations, and their food truck, have some of the best gyros you'll find in the area.  My favorite is the ""original"":  pork gyro meat with tomato, onion, and tzatziki wrapped in a soft pita.  The meat is that salty and savory, complimented by the brightness of the tomatoes and onions.  Everything is pulled together and cooled down with a smothering of tzatziki.  These gyros are messy.  Don't bring a first-date here unless you want to look like you're incapable of feeding yourself.  On your way out, stop at CVS and pick up a roll of paper towels just so you can keep your composure while you feast.  Service here is *fast*.  If there's a line out the door, don't let it deter you... they fly through the line.  There is extremely limited seating in all of the locations, it's meant to be a takeout place
Name: Saloniki Greek; Review: You know, it's not the most authentic, but that doesn't mean it isn't good. I had the George pita, and it was really killer! Loved it. The atmosphere in the restaurant is nice, and I love dining in as opposed to getting takeout from this place. The staff are nice and helpful, but they're mostly clueless young kids, so you have to give them some time to ask around if you have any serious questions (as a clueless young kid myself, I'm glad Saloniki is employing them, but maybe having at least one veteran staff member at the restaurant at all times would be a good idea). Don't go here if you're looking for traditional avgolemono or anything, but if you're looking for a killer pita and fries, this is your spot
Name: GRECO; Review: Service is very fast here! The servers are also friendly and willing to explain the menu (won't make fun of you for not being able to say the names of the dishes). They do social distance customers and have plenty of area to wait for your food. You can eat outside or take out your food.  Classic Bifteki: The meat inside this was so flavorful and juicy, I was jealous I didn't order this meat myself. The feta cheese mix was great and not too spicy.  Build your own: I chose the pita with pork and tzatziki sauce. The meat was a little dry but very flavorful. I loved the sauce and if you like cucumbers you should try this sauce. It was so refreshing and went well with all the other flavors. Just in case you aren't aware if you add onions they will be raw, same with the tomato.  Greco Fries: MY FAVORITE FRIES! These were so flavorful and the feta on top made them great. The fries themselves were crispy and had seasoning but weren't too salty. The feta added to the top made it feel less greasy than just eating french fries. 100% will be ordering again!  Yaya's: My favorite donuts! They are made fresh so eat them quickly after ordering or they will get soggy. The chocolate sauce is so delicious, I wish I could buy a bottle of it! I loved the texture that the oreo topping added to the donut bites. I will definitely order this again when I come back!  Kataifi: These were also very crisp and definitely made fresh! The sauce on top was a thick custard that was only slightly sweet so this is a great option if you don't like sweet desserts. I loved the pistachio pieces on top because of both the texture and flavor but it mostly tasted of custard","Name: Saloniki Greek; Review: Just tried Saloniki for the first time and I am very happy that it's a part of the Fenway community!

Name: GRECO; Review: Food was okay. I got the chicken gyro but subbed honey mustard for tzatziki sauce. I found the meat a little bland and the fries desperately needed more salt. I would probably order the next one without any fries because they detracted from overall experience so much. Additionally, I didnt see prices their drinks I got a canned tea (company is greek so thats cool) and I'm pretty sure it was close to $5 that's ridiculous. The Loumounades!!!!!!! ORDER THEM!! They are made fresh and in house. I got the classic ones with honey, cinnamon and walnuts. This dessert is delightful. The balls are fried perfectly. They retain their crunchy exterior even after being covered in honey. The Loumounades themselves are not sweet which is lovely so you don't end up with sugar overload. Additionally, this greek honey is like no other honey I've had. It is delicious and not cloying in the slightest. Do yourself a favour and order them. This was the highlight of my meal. The service was top notch. They person taking my order was patient and friendly. They brought everything out and even brought me napkins. It was a friendly environment and the decor is super cute","Name: KAVA neo-taverna; Review: DINNER REVIEW  After living in Boston for 9 months and hearing so many good things about Kava, I finally found an opportunity when my mom was in town (we both love Greek food). They don't take reservations so that had been a deterrent up to this point. But we were in no rush and were willing to go put our name in early so that's what we did.  We got there at 6:30 PM and put our name in...they said it would be 30-45 minutes so we went to grab a drink at Banyan nearby. This place is so small that you cannot grab a drink here...all the bar seats will be full with drinkers or diners. After an hour, we decided to go see where we were on the list and they said there was one party ahead of us but that there were two bar seats available. Bar seats are first come, first served and we don't mind sitting at the bar so that's what we did.  TIP: Be prepared to wait. Luckily it's worth the wait and there are tons of places nearby to grab a drink. Or just walk around the South End and admire the beautiful homes.  SETTING: This place is tiny (maybe only 40 seats or so) which makes it very intimate. You can easily hear the conversations of your neighbors. It's dimly lit and has rope accents everywhere (the lights hang from ropes, the bar shelves hang from ropes etc.). There's an old Greek guy painted on the wall. Love the decor here.  SERVICE: Our server was courteous and attentive. Zero complaints.  FOOD: The menu is made up of small plates, meant to share, and it's not too big, which makes decisions a bit easier. That said, it has quite a diverse menu so you will definitely find something you like. All the menu items are in the original Greek with descriptions below which add to the authenticity of the meal. The bread is some of the best bread I've had at a restaurant so even if you're on a ""gluten-free"" or ""paleo"" diet, try this with some olive oil and you won't regret it.  Here is what we ordered, in order of what I would recommend to others. Even so, I would recommend everything we got to get again but I would, of course, like to try some different things when I go back.  Kolokithakia (zucchini chips with tzatziki) - HOW!? I demand to know how they make this. Kava owners, if you are reading this, please message me how you make these bites of heaven. I have had zucchini chips before but not like this. First of all, they come served like a blooming flower, held up by the delicious tzatziki on the bottom. They are a little puffy but so light and the fried portion does not come off the zucchini portion AT ALL. The zucchini is tender and warm but not disintegrating into mush. 100% would get this again.  Paidakia (grilled lamb chops with fries) - If you don't eat meat...it's okay, they make lamb! These are just classic Greek lamb chops prepared with olive oil, oregano, and lemon. We ate these with our hands and had no shame about it. Definitely on the pricier side ($38) for the amount of meat you get but delicious. Fries were good to dip in the leftover tzatziki from the above!  Horiatiki (Greek salad with tomatoes, cucumbers, bell pepper, feta etc.) - these tomatoes were some of the best-tasting I've ever had. This is a nice, light salad to balance out the meal with some of the heavier meat you will order.  Oktapodi (grilled octopus) - Can't go wrong with grilled octopus. They come in little slices so no cutting necessary.  TIP: Greeks are not known for their desserts and they only really have a dessert of the day (in this case, baklava) and greek yogurt with berries. Go elsewhere for dessert.  Can't wait to come back to Kava

Name: Atha's Famous Roast Beef; Review: I was not impressed at all.the steak n cheese sub was way over priced and almost unedible it was so dry.the bread seemed old.not soft whatsoever. Everything on the menu was overpriced in my opinion.although there is a huge selection of pizza.subs.and dinner plates. Maybe if they shortened the menu to a few specialties and bumped up the quality of food . they would be a place I'd return to. Me being Greek I was drawn there by the name and was dissapointed to see not much of a selection of Greek ingredients and more Italian. Gyros. With lamb and feta cheese.souvlaki should be on skewers with tomatoes onion or veggies. Not just said to be grille

Name: Derne Street Deli; Review: I've been going here for the past 5 years. This is your casual sit in or take out spot. The staff is very friendly and humble. They have a Mediterranean fusion going on. and their portion sizes are pretty big. I'm always really full after I'm finished with my dish. A few of the dishes I tried:  -a Greek style falafel sandwich with tzaziki sauce (very tasty with fresh pita) -chicken salad sandwich (they don't skimp out on the chicken) - Cheeseburger and fries (delicious) -Veggie Omelette with Cheese (pepper, onion, mushrooms absolutely YES! I'm an omelette freak) - Pizza (go for the Greek pizza with olives and feta) - egg, cheese, and turkey on a bagel (breakfast to GO) -Chocolate Chip cookies (baked fresh every day) :)  They're exactly the type of small family owned business you'd want to keep going to

Name: Sprout Mediterranean Inspired Salads; Review: I normally come here before evening events at the MFA for their pizza. They always have great pizza. This time I went to their Greek side and am really glad I did. Really delicious. Vegetables are very fresh. Lamb is great. If I lived over here I'd be very regular"
Vietnamese pho places,"Name: Saigon Hut; Review: This is one of the best places to eat pho, period. Not in east Boston, not in Boston. One of the best. I’ve had pho from all across the US and nothing else compares, even in the heart of Vietnamese neighborhoods on the east coast. And it doesn’t just stop at pho - the menu is large and has quite a bit of variety, but everything I’ve had here so far was great. There’s even vegan options available, and according to my vegan friends, the veggie pho is worth raving about too.  I could talk about this place all night.The price is good, the quality is amazing. The owner is so sweet and nice, to the point you feel like family. There isn’t a reason to not eat here. If you like pho, you have to stop here
Name: Phở Lê Restaurant; Review: OK so I'm a mi dang and grew up around  the Vietnamese community, I ordered a bowl of Pho Ga Xe Lua at ""Pho Le"" yesterday. When I say the noodles weren't fresh at all! Listen, I love vietnamese food more then american cuisine and would rather eat different food from different ethnic backgrounds on a daily basis. But to give me old noodles that I had to break apart in luke warm water? As if the noodles take long to boil, and I'm not about this PHO LIFE is pure laziness... I'm use to tasting the love in the Viet food I eat, like somebody's grandma put their whole foot in it toe nail and all lol, it's just an expression...... But even a black man knows fresh rice noodles don't stick......😒😒😒 it's only right to say Anh Hong And Saigon Seafood are still the best places to go for Pho in Dorchester not even Pho Hoa has what it truly takes... If you want Ca Nuong go to Pho 2000, their pho is good too but Aslong as your precooking your noodles and refrigerating them you will fail........... Do better Pho Le...........  I still tipped yall too so y'all can't call me cheap...
Name: Pho Hoa; Review: Been here several times before. My go to Pho place in Boston. I used to think this was the best Pho place in Chinatown. However, this last time, the Pho was not as flavorful and they were more skimpy on the meat. Perhaps the place changed hands or cooks or maybe just an off day. But reason enough to try one of the other places next time
Name: Pho Basil; Review: This was the second pho place I've visited in Boston (first being Pho Pasteur). I got the Dac Biet, which was very good. I wanted to get the best pho on the menu, and this was it. I asked the waiter about the sizes and she confirmed that they were all large (she, nor the menu, didnt indicate whether you could get a smaller or larger bowl and if that would affect the price). Though the pho was good, I would say that it was more expensive that pho Pasteur (the cheapest pho here was pho ga for 9.50). The service and ambiance here are definitely better here than at pho Pasteur, though I felt they skimped on the sprouts and Basil (see pic). For now, I will keep going to Pho Pasteur by myself because of its price, but pho Basil will be the place to take my guests (and maybe by myself one in a while). Lastly, please don't go by the prices on the google maps menu for this place
Name: Pho & I House Of Noodle And Rice; Review: Ordered the pho biet. In terms of the food, the broth was nearly tasteless. Compared to pho Basil, pho Pasteur, and the pho I ate while in Vietnam, this is bar far the least appetizing pho I have ever tasted. There is one size, so you can't order less or more. We also ordered carb Rangoon, which were the only good part of what we ate. With the pho, you only get one small plate of Basil, lime, etc. The waiter was also not pleasant at all. We felt rushed, and she seemed impatient, as if she didn't want us there. Never going back and would not recommend","Name: Saigon Hut; Review: This is one of the best places to eat pho, period.

Name: Pho Hoa; Review: I love this place! The atmosphere is a bit lacking but it's fairly clean and spacious, and quiet, which are three things that aren't always easy to find in Chinatown (mostly holes in the wall that are crowded, cramped, and often not very sanitary.) The food is always great--I've come here at least 10 times and their prices are dirt cheap. You can get a family size humongous bowl of Pho for about 10 bucks, and their pho is fresh and tasty, not too salty or sweet. The staff are attentive but not overly so, so they leave you to chat and aren't constantly interrupting you, which I like. I highly recommend
Name: New Saigon; Review: Obviously they have great pho, the beef noodle soup that is Vietnam's most famous export,  but don't miss out on the other Vietnamese specialties like the pan roasted bbq quail or the fantastically authentic banh mi sandwiches, loaded with crisp julienned vegetables and other fillings.  The place is BYOB and the owner and his daughters couldn't possibly be more gracious and hospitable.  If you're unfamiliar with Vietnamese food, they'll offer some guidance but it helps to read a wiki article or two in advance.   The food is light, fresh, and healthy, without any of the heavy starchy sugary sauces which you sometimes find in American-style Chinese food

Name: Saigon Hut; Review: I go for the Pho. Sai Gon is unique considering the high Spanish speaking demographics of the Meridian Street side of Eastie. Sai Gon could have set up shop in Jeffries Point but they chose Meridian Street. There is never a wait and the soup is delicious and plentiful. They also offer bubble teas and smoothies and I recommend melon (honeydew) if you can get it. I gave a four star because when it comes to solo dining whether eat in or take out you really need cash they won't do debit/credit for small orders and I think the prices are high for the location East Boston. I can see having a $15 bill for pho and a coffee if the place was in Jeffries Point because the hipsters and yuppies live there.

Not in east Boston, not in Boston. One of the best. I’ve had pho from all across the US and nothing else compares, even in the heart of Vietnamese neighborhoods on the east coast. And it doesn’t just stop at pho - the menu is large and has quite a bit of variety, but everything I’ve had here so far was great. There’s even vegan options available, and according to my vegan friends, the veggie pho is worth raving about too.  I could talk about this place all night.The price is good, the quality is amazing.

Name: Pho Hoa; Review: I love this place! The atmosphere is a bit lacking but it's fairly clean and spacious, and quiet, which are three things that aren't always easy to find in Chinatown (mostly holes in the wall that are crowded, cramped, and often not very sanitary.) The food is always great--I've come here at least 10 times and their prices are dirt cheap. You can get a family size humongous bowl of Pho for about 10 bucks, and their pho is fresh and tasty, not too salty or sweet. The staff are attentive but not overly so, so they leave you to chat and aren't constantly interrupting you, which I like. I highly recommend

Name: New Saigon; Review: Obviously they have great pho, the beef noodle soup that is Vietnam's most famous export,  but don't miss out on the other Vietnamese specialties like the pan roasted bbq quail or the fantastically authentic banh mi sandwiches, loaded with crisp julienned vegetables and other fillings.  The place is BYOB and the owner and his daughters couldn't possibly be more gracious and hospitable.  If you're unfamiliar with Vietnamese food, they'll offer some guidance but it helps to read a wiki article or two in advance.   The food is light, fresh, and healthy, without any of the heavy starchy sugary sauces which you sometimes find in American-style Chinese food

Name: Saigon Hut; Review: I go for the Pho. Sai Gon is unique considering the high Spanish speaking demographics of the Meridian Street side of Eastie. Sai Gon could have set up shop in Jeffries Point but they chose Meridian Street. There is never a wait and the soup is delicious and plentiful. They also offer bubble teas and smoothies and I recommend melon (honeydew) if you can get it. I gave a four star because when it comes to solo dining whether eat in or take out you really need cash they won't do debit/credit for small orders and I think the prices are high for the location East Boston. I can see having a $15 bill for pho and a coffee if the place was in Jeffries Point because the hipsters and yuppies live there. Meridian Street is working class/blue collar but gentrification forces all businesses to charge a lot.

A lot of times I don't like going to Fusion restaurants because I feel like they do one type of Cuisine well but the other not as well. I can honestly say that this restaurant has really good Vietnamese food and really good Thai food. When I went here I ordered Thai food which was really delicious and a Vietnamese side dish which is also very good. My friend ordered a Vietnamese pho noodle and it was amazing. I honestly didn't expect that they would do both Cuisines so well together. Also, I came here for lunch and the prices were really reasonable and I would say even on the cheap side. I even had enough food to take home so that I could eat the next day. The service was great and the staff was very attentive. The food came out looking great, tasting great and at a reasonable pace. Keep in mind that this place does get really busy though even on a weekday. I think that every time I've been here I've had to wait for a seat. Even when I walked by the restaurant always looks packed. I definitely recommend coming here to try some Thai or Vietnamese food or both

Name: Phở Số 1 Boston; Review: Finding parking here is a hassle.  The only thing  that is good here is Bo Ne (item from their secret menu) and everything else is mediocre.  I have tried their vermicelli, pho and rice plates. They put way too much oil in their vermicelli noodle and on their rice plates they put too much salt on their meat. The pho is very impressive and i rather go somewhere else

Name: Saigon Fusion; Review: Glad they have reopened.  This is one of the best Vietnamese places in the area (along with Viet Citron out in Burlington).  We have been to so many Vietnamese places in Dorchester, Quincy, Roxbury in the past few months but they don’t compare to Saigon Fusion.  Pho is excellent - quality beef and not the dry, tough slices like other places. Broth is hearty and not just salty.  Banh mi is the best around - bread is freshly baked, and flavors are excellent. My jaw doesn’t hurt after eating.  Also the rice plates are excellent. Our kids loved the grilled pork over rice, and they are some of the pickiest eaters

Name: New Saigon; Review: Solid Vietnamese food. It has that authentic hole-in-the-wall vibe that will be a plus for some and not for others. The pho, bun, and bahn mi are all good and very fresh tasting. Definitely worth checking out if you like pho. The portion sizes were also spot on (the extra large is huge, very tasty). The combo fried rice was a bit bland and seemed to use frozen vegetables, not very impressed with that one. I think the the lemongrass fried rice or pork chop rice are probably better rice options. Only been here a handful of times so far, but would recommend it as a solid Vietnamese option if you're in the area

Name: Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steakhouse; Review: Couldn’t Get Any Worse  My daughter and I arrived for our reservation this evening and were placed at a table for 10 even though there were just 2 of us. We were seated at opposite sides of the table, with about 5 feet between us. I guess they expected us to communicate with our cell phones. I asked if we could have a smaller table. After all, the restaurant was mostly empty. I was told that they were all reserved due to social distancing. If they were truly social distancing they would not take all 20 people in the restaurant and confine them all to one small area, they would spread them out throughout the restaurant. Apparently, no one told them that the reason restaurants must operate at reduced occupancy is so that people can spread out.  Although it was 7:45 p.m. and they weren’t closing until 10:00 p.m., our unpleasant waitress seemed in a rush to take our order. She approached us 3 times to take our order during the first 7 or 8 minutes we were in the restaurant. The woman was not friendly and had a take it or leave it attitude.  We both ordered the 45 day dry-aged prime rib eye as our main entree. It was very clear what we had ordered as the waitress did make it a point to explain that medium would be a red center. My daughter wanted her steak cooked a bit more than medium. I was happy with medium. I usually go medium rare, but after the description I went with medium.  A short while later a young lady (not our waitress) returned with two steaks. A busser dropped off the sides. The two steaks looked nothing alike. Mine was clearly a rib eye. My daughter immediately realized that the steak they placed before her was a strip steak. The young lady insisted that they were both rib eyes and educated us that not all steaks look alike. She pointed out to my daughter that the gristle on the side of her strip steak was actually the cap of the rib eye. A little knowledge is a dangerous thing. I asked her to please check with the kitchen because It did not look like a rib eye. She came back with the steak and said, the cook has confirmed that this is a rib eye. Believing that they know more than I about steak, after all it is their business, we accepted the steaks.  My daughter cut into her steak and showed me and we both immediately saw that it was a strip steak. We called the young lady back and she agreed to get another steak. Our waitress apparently couldn’t be bothered, not her problem.  We split the one rib eye, eating it and our sides out of our 4 inch bread dishes. No one thought to get us a set up. A short while later, another woman, who represented herself as the manager, brought the replacement steak, this time a rib eye. She said sorry for the confusion,  and made some comment about how the kitchen thought the steak was a rib eye, but she told them that she didn’t think so. She asked that my daughter cut into the steak to make sure it was OK. The steak was very red, so apparently the instructions never got relayed to the kitchen the second time around. This goes back to our server who didn’t bother to concern herself with the issue. But at this point, we were not up for any more drama, so my daughter accepted the steak.  The food was good, albeit the steak was a bit salty. When they finally provided the correct steak it was not cooked as requested. The evening was a disaster and a regrettable experience.  The way we were seated, the poor service, bad attitude, the way our dinner was served, the lack of anyone taking responsibility, the lack of an apology, the bad/loud music.  I am bothered by the fact that no one in a so called high end steak house knows a rib eye from a strip steak. I am even more bothered if they knew the difference, but rather than fix their error, they decided to BS a patron who they thought didn’t know any better, perhaps because she was a young woman. My daughter is a student of the culinary arts and a registered dietitian. On top of everything else we had to pay for an unpleasant experience
Name: Boston Chops South End; Review: I went to Boston Chops last night to celebrate my friend and I’s birthdays and we wanted to treat ourselves to a nice steak dinner. Another friend came along. The service was pretty good at the start, and the server was friendly, but right in the middle where we needed her attention the most she kind of disappeared. I figured she got busy so it wasn’t a big deal, but after reading about other people’s experience with service I was a bit surprised. My friend and I both got the filet and another friend got the tuna. I always get my steak medium well - when mine first came out, it was definitely medium rare so I sent it back and asked for it to be cooked more. They did, but it was still pretty undercooked and they also hadn’t let it rest at all so I lost most of the good flavor trying to cut into it.  I ate it anyway because I was paying $45 for it and I didn’t want to be “that person” to send a steak back twice, but for that price at a steakhouse I’d think they should know how to cook a steak to the requested temperature the first time. But, the sides were good even though I didn’t get to have my steak with any of the sauce because it was kind of mixed in the sides and I was hungry so I ate them while waiting for my steak to come back. I also think that for the price of the wine, they could have been a bit more generous with the pour.  Just a head’s up, they’re currently only serving bottled water and it’s $6 per bottle. I get that that they probably need to bring in extra costs however they can so that doesn’t bother me, but we weren’t expecting it so just wanted to let other future diners know","Name: Puerto Rican Flavors; Review: The best steak in Springfiel
Name: Texas Roadhouse; Review: Want a delicious mouthwatering NY strip steak??? Oh boy, this is the place to go!  Have been here several times, (recommend getting there early as you will be waiting to be seated)  We usually will sit at the bar, as you get faster service and the bartenders are very attentive. Make sure you go with an appetite, you will most certainly leave there stuffed to the gills!  Bar area is small, but cozy.  I always order the NY strip steak, moderately priced and worth every penny.  You start with a nice drink, order your meal and  while waiting there is a bucket of peanuts to snack on, but once they bring the rolls, you will forget the peanuts. Hot delicious rolls served with cinnamon butter, to die for (really)  While you are there, you may catch the waitstaff doing a line dance or them singing to a customer celebrating their birthday, always entertaining!!  The meal comes in a reasonable time cooked to perfection, nice portions. The steak literally melts in your mouth. Served with a baked potato and veggies the meal is fantastic.  They do have a desert menu, but honestly we have never had any, as we are way to full!  Again GO here if you want awesome steaks!
Name: Grill 23 & Bar; Review: Wow.. really really must visit place. Wanted to go to a well known place to try the Waygu Steak for the first time and this place blew it out of the park. We had a party  of 6 and absolutely no one went away upset. The place is very very awesome. I had to try the Waygu A5 Prefecture Japan Steak.....it was only 2oz for $52 but so so so worth the experience .... I have never in my entire life tastes a steak as tender and delicious as this. It literally melted away in my mouth like butter. And that was just the start of the unbelievable feast we had.  I also had the shellfish sampler which was amazing and had lobster tails, oysters , shrimp, and this fantastic crab salad. Then we had the soft shell crab special....delicious. And the crudo which was fantastic as well... Then for my main I had the American Kobe Cap Steak with blue cheese crust and on the side (I asked for it on the side instead of on top) I had King Crab Oscar and Asparagus... OMG ...it was so good. Delicious... super tender and cooked to perfection. The sides with it were outstanding .....the Japanese Sweet Potatoes were seriously the best sweet potatoes I have ever tasted..and then the mushrooms were great as well. Drinks were great ...and their drink menu is ridiculous. We ended the night with desserts that were really delicious. The Coconut Cake came with homemade pineapple and other fruit ice cream that was some of the best ice cream I have ever had.....the Creme Brulee was great as well...and the chocolate cookies were out of this world. It was a very expensive night but well worth it. Service was really good and we will definitely be back for another visit. I seriously want people to know that the Waygu Steak A5 will literally be the best steak you have ever tasted in your entire life. Guaranteed. A must visit. You will spend a lot of money but what you taste for it is worth it. Great Great place. Well done. Picture I posted of the Kobe Steak doesnt do it justice. It was amazing.  #BuddhaRevie

I only thing I really miss is the presentation that they used to do at the old one, where they would show you all the cuts of beef and explain the process on how the steaks are aged to perfection etc and the dessert tray they would roll out after you meal .

I finally got my husband to go to Morton's the other day while we were at the Seaport trade center for business and I told him that there is no way in hell we can not no go there after for dinner since it is across the street..lol So we went and he LOVED it..

Name: Boston Chops South End; Review: OMG! WOW! MEGA! etc, etc, etc ...  When looking for a steakhouse in Boston, the choice is relatively manageable, but high priced, they are all. But the Boston Chops is still the cheapest and has promised me the most from the map. Especially as far as the side dishes were concerned, these were not quite as unusual as at the other steakhouses. Also not quite as fish-heavy as in the other restaurants.   There are two Boston Chops, this was closer to our hotel so we could walk there. Both are beautifully decorated, stylish and almost luxurious. Nice with the dimmed light, the walls and furniture are also rather dark. My reservation had worked out and we got a nice 2s table quite central. Our service Alex was super nice and I was very happy that we were sitting at his table. Especially as far as steaks were concerned he was a great help as there are many steaks to choose from and I do not know all the steaks, but his descriptions were great. I decided to go for the 400 gram Prime Rib Eye Steak and was in heaven, so tender and delicious !!! I also had homemade macaroni and cheese, also gigantic. You should bring a lot of hunger, the portions are large. Before that there was still bread from the kitchen with butter, also great. The woman had a cauliflower steak (vegetarian) with asparagus, she also raved about. A bottle of wine (the selection of wines is great) with a dessert which we shared, and then we were already at 160 € for the evening. With tips 200 €, but I would always pay again, everything was OK !!!!   Clear recommendation on my part !!"
Ethiopian cuisine nearby,"Name: Lucy Ethiopian Cafe; Review: First time trying Ethiopian food and had an overall good experience at Lucy. Came for lunch at noon on a Sunday after a snow storm so we were one of two groups there.  Setting: nothing special. Tile floor in the bottom of a building on Mass Ave. You don't come to the Ethiopian restaurants for the ambiance.  Service: Very nice waitress who gave us an extra side dish...it pays to be nice to people!  Food: So for those who haven't had Ethiopian food before, it often comes on this thin bread called Injera (made from Teff flour). You use the bread, which is chewy, to scoop up all the yummy flavors in front of you. We ordered the combo for two which came with well-spiced beef chunks in the middle surrounded by lentils, potatoes, spinach, chickpea, and collard greens. The beef was my favorite part of the meal but I was slightly disappointed that the injera and some of the sides weren't warm...I expected everything to be at least warm, if not hot. The flavors were there across the board, just the temperature of the food could be improved (perhaps it was a fluke!).  Definitely not a place to take a first date...it's hard to have good manners eating Ethiopian food
Name: Addis Red Sea; Review: I love the entire experience of eating Ethiopian food. And Addis Red Sea is one of the best places for it.  We came early for dinner on a Friday evening and were promptly ushered to a table. We ordered the Tej (Ethiopian honey wine) and the Ethiopian tea. Both were excellent. The wine was sweet as expected. Ethiopian tea isn't served with milk but is spiced, and was quite tasty.  We ordered the doro alcha combination with three veggies and the yasa tibs (fried fish fillet). All of it served with injera, a spongy crepe. The experience of sharing your food is really great! The injera here is not too sour for which I'm thankful. The chicken in the doro alcha was tender and well cooked. All the veggie dishes were tasty too. The yasa tibs however was bland, no spices at all and didn't taste quite fresh.  Service was attentive and all our questions regarding the food were answered. The ambiance is pretty cozy too. A little dimly lit with beautiful Ethiopian artifacts and paintings adorning the walls.  There are so many different options to try on their menu, that we'll surely be back soon. Can't wait to try their sambusa
Name: Blue Nile Restaurant; Review: The injera was not fresh at all and that is the base of the meal. This is my first and LAST time here. The restaurants in the DMV are WAY better and I am still looking for a restaurant similar. There is also a weird rule that one ""entree"" per person but normally Ethiopian food is ordered to share. They also forgot my drink and did not serve anyone water until a white family came in. The tea normally called chai that we ordered was not Ethiopian tea (normally classified by certain spices) but rather Lipton tea and a stick of cinnamon. The apple and white grape cider was 3.50 and served in a wine glass when it was s glorified small serving of sparkling welches juice. We also requested a side of tomato salad which is a common side in Ethiopian foods and was ensured that all entrees come with a salad that is filled with tomatoes instead we were met with a disappointment to salads everywhere there was literally 2 slices of tomato. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else that has more reasonable prices because this is not representative of the wonderful culture that comes from Ethiopia
Name: Lucy Ethiopian Cafe; Review: There is a bad attitude in this restaurant towards a member of their own Ethiopian community even though they use the name ""Ethiopian"" cafe & restaurant for their business, I had a horrible experience in this restaurant when I tried to pick up my ordered food, the front service guy had intentionally tried to humiliate me and let me to wait when he saw another white person who came after me, so when I picked my food he grabbed my hand up to my shirt tore and my covid face mask fall off plus insulted me and he was about to fight with me for no reason, then I called to the police, all this happened just for the sake of under $20 food.

The restaurant itself is quite small, located in a busy neighborhood. We ordered 4 different dishes along with their in-house honey wine. The wine was bit too sweet for us, but was okay. The food took almost 20 minutes to arrive at our table, but food was delicious! We ordered one lamb dish (Yebeg Tibs), two beef dishes (Lega Tibs & Tibs Fir Fir) and one vegetarian combo dish (with Misir Wet, Shiro Wet, Yatakilt Wet & Yekik Alicha). Food was served on the traditional Ethiopean bread Injera, which you will find similar in texture and taste to Indian Dosa. The lamb and beef dishes were quite spicy but were very tasty. The vegetarian combo meal was less spicy, but was great too! If you crave for spicy food, you should definitely try this place; I am going back soon

Service: Very nice waitress who gave us an extra side dish...it pays to be nice to people!  Food: So for those who haven't had Ethiopian food before, it often comes on this thin bread called Injera (made from Teff flour). You use the bread, which is chewy, to scoop up all the yummy flavors in front of you. We ordered the combo for two which came with well-spiced beef chunks in the middle surrounded by lentils, potatoes, spinach, chickpea, and collard greens. The beef was my favorite part of the meal but I was slightly disappointed that the injera and some of the sides weren't warm...I expected everything to be at least warm, if not hot. The flavors were there across the board, just the temperature of the food could be improved (perhaps it was a fluke!).  Definitely not a place to take a first date...it's hard to have good manners eating Ethiopian food

Name: Addis Red Sea; Review: I've been too both the Cambridge and Boston locations now, but prefer the schlep to Cambridge from Brookline, instead of Back Bay. I order the vegetarian platter for 2, which is what I order at about any Ethiopian restaurant, and added a beef dish as well. I wasn't fond of the ""white"" injera the brown teff is much more flavorful, and a couple of the dishes I chose for the platter  (similar or the same to ones I always choose) were pretty bland. Good, but bland.  Wait staff was pleasant, and compensated our beverage orders because they were out of an original choice of something we wanted to order.  The Cambridge location is fairly wheelchair accessible, well barrier free at least, this one is downstairs. So if you're mobility impaired in regards to stairs, just be advised there are about a half a flight, and no railing.

The restaurant itself is quite small, located in a busy neighborhood. We ordered 4 different dishes along with their in-house honey wine. The wine was bit too sweet for us, but was okay. The food took almost 20 minutes to arrive at our table, but food was delicious! We ordered one lamb dish (Yebeg Tibs), two beef dishes (Lega Tibs & Tibs Fir Fir) and one vegetarian combo dish (with Misir Wet, Shiro Wet, Yatakilt Wet & Yekik Alicha). Food was served on the traditional Ethiopean bread Injera, which you will find similar in texture and taste to Indian Dosa. The lamb and beef dishes were quite spicy but were very tasty. The vegetarian combo meal was less spicy, but was great too! If you crave for spicy food, you should definitely try this place; I am going back soon

Name: Addis Red Sea; Review: I love the entire experience of eating Ethiopian food. And Addis Red Sea is one of the best places for it.  We came early for dinner on a Friday evening and were promptly ushered to a table. We ordered the Tej (Ethiopian honey wine) and the Ethiopian tea. Both were excellent. The wine was sweet as expected. Ethiopian tea isn't served with milk but is spiced, and was quite tasty.  We ordered the doro alcha combination with three veggies and the yasa tibs (fried fish fillet). All of it served with injera, a spongy crepe. The experience of sharing your food is really great! The injera here is not too sour for which I'm thankful. The chicken in the doro alcha was tender and well cooked. All the veggie dishes were tasty too. The yasa tibs however was bland, no spices at all and didn't taste quite fresh.  Service was attentive and all our questions regarding the food were answered. The ambiance is pretty cozy too. A little dimly lit with beautiful Ethiopian artifacts and paintings adorning the walls.  There are so many different options to try on their menu, that we'll surely be back soon. Can't wait to try their sambusa

Name: Blue Nile Restaurant; Review: Even as an Ethiopian, I still give Blue Nile a 5 star. First timer. The famous Chicken Wet is definitely one of the best. Forget 'bout it! When they take their time in making it, as they always should, it shows at the end. Truly surprised! It definitely hit the spot (as you can tell). Thank you guys! Keep the 'No Short Cut' policy alive! Bless! P.S Managed a restaurant before, and one piece of advise to keep your quality the same, is to take time in training the cook. You will get tired, as restaurant business is touch, but make sure you train the next cook for at least a month. And slowly, write the recipes, timing, temprature...etc on a piece of paper. Although difficult, if you guys plan ahead, there's a way to keep this quality for long time. Thx again

Find some Cajun restaurants in the area,"Name: Augusta Market; Review: Best Cajun chicken sub ever! They make their own chicken.

Name: Boston fried chicken; Review: Wasn’t the worse but just was not good! If your use to the NY fried chicken restaurants in the Boston area, you will not like this place.

Name: Shaking Crab (Boston Common); Review: A unique and special food excursion that must be tried! Everything is incredibly tasty, from the fried lobster tail appetizer to all the various sauces that the main seafood boils/bags come with. As long as you aren't afraid to get a little messy and eat with your hands, this is one of the top seafood restaurants around (and even with takeout they do supply gloves and bibs). I personally get the Alaskan king crab legs, which is a relative steal for what they charge. The shrimp and crawfish are also excellent, but take a little more work to get to the meat. As someone who can't handle a lot of spice, I go for the butter and garlic sauce which is nice, but I wish they had a milder version of the Cajun sauce as that flavor is amazing. And definitely don't forget the fries for dipping in the sauce","Name: French Quarter; Review: Finally! Boston finally has an authentic New Orleans style restaurant. Everything from the cocktails to the desserts feel like they were ubered up from NOLA right then and there.  We visited the restaurant last month for a celebratory dinner and pigged out on just about everything. The crab cakes, fried chicken, BLACKENED SALMON, beignets, and bourbon pecan pie were ALL out of this world.  Seriously, I can’t recommend this restaurant enough. I’ve been raving about it to everyone I know. In a post Covid world, I’m sure this place is going to be packed every weekend
Name: Cajun & Grill; Review: I stopped by this place to take some Mexican food to go for my trip back to NYC. I ordered a bowl which consisted of grilled chicken, rice, beans and everything else I could possibly fit into the bowl. The portion was generous as I was able to have 2 portions - 1 for dinner and the other for lunch the next day. Was very filling and satisfying. A bowl and a bottle of water came to about $11 with tax
Name: French Quarter; Review: Went down to this new restaurant on Washington Street in downtown crossing and what a pleasant surprise.  The decor, lighting, food and service were all top notch.  The drink menu was right off a little bistro near Bourbon Street and the food was perfectly spiced and flavored (with a majority of the menu able to be served gluten free).  The staff was courteous, knowledgable and very friendly.  All in all a great night and cannot wait to go back and try some more things (oyster and liver apps and fried chicken dinner were amazing
Name: Cajun & Grill; Review: Pretty good mexican food that doesn't take a long time for it to come out especially when you're in a rush to catch your next train to Worcester. It may sound expensive, but a chicken quesadilla may be a good dinner as the portion is huge. Overall, pretty good quesadillas and nice service
Name: French Quarter; Review: I am a Boston Foodie!!! I travel all around Massachusetts looking for great food and BIPOC safe restaurants and this restaurant gets my approval. It is not Black owned but the staff are POC and the Chef is PHENOMENAL! If I remember correctly he is from Louisiana and you can taste it in the cooking. I am from Boston but my family and tribes are spread all over the South. My fav is NC and New Orleans, this food is the closest you will ever get to that NOLA TASTE in Boston","Name: Holly Crab; Review: This is not even close to a Cajun crab place. First, the flavor of the food can be described in one word: spicy. If the owner of the restaurant equates spicy to Cajun, then you have not tried real Cajun. Don't advertise your place as Cajun if all you have is spicy food. Second, price. The market price of a pound of king crab leg is ridiculous. It's about $5 to $10 per pound more than other places I have been to, let alone the ones in New Orleans. I guess there is no competitors in this area so they can charge whatever they want. Third, the tools they provide with you to work on the crab legs, they suck. Not sure why they don't use the standard ones which have a little hook that you can pry open the legs easily. The only good part about this place is they give you a pair of gloves so you don't smell like a crab for a week. I would not recommend this place to anyone who loves Cajun food and think they are going to get good Cajun food here

Name: Cap't Loui; Review: Wow, bummed out. Shrimp boil tasted frozen and then over cooked. Calamari so overcooked, you couldn't taste the calamari.  The oysters on the half-shell were the best part. Chowder was... meh.  No crawfish on the menu tonight... Carbonated drinks were also off the menu tonight even with the liquor store right at the corner.  Our server was very nice. He said he would pass our concerns along to the manager. If he did, the manager wasn't interested in hearing anything because they never came to our table.  Really disappointed... So many great restaurants in the area that really do a great job. Wish we hadn't wasted our time

Name: Real Deal, LLC; Review: Covid helpful info: parallel street parking, no meters. Most times of the day you can find a spot near this location. Once you walk into the joint you will go to the cashier to get your food. They have 2-3 tables inside but not sure if you can dine in there. No tables to dine out, it is mostly a location people do take out or delivery from.  This location is a local favorite for me. I used to live near the Cleveland Circle location, hang out with friends near the JP one, and now I live by the West Roxbury location and I love them all equally. Their food is consistent and they are always quick. My favorite app that I get almost every time is their onion rings because they are really yummy but I am a big fan of sauces and their kickin bayou sauce is delicious! The sauce is like a sriracha, Mayo, and other yummy things (real deal sorry if I’m wrong with those ingredients!) Meals I typically get are the Joe Spa (chicken Caesar wrap), Reuben, grown up grilled cheese, any burger, and any pizza. Definitely would recommend going to any of their locations

Name: Le Foyer Bakery; Review: This place is a staple in the Haitian community in Boston They serve pastries and baked goods from haitian culture. the patties are most likely the best seller here (known to run out) also the loafs of bread are quite popular.  the prices are fair. the beef patties are practically meatless which is one the reasons I rated it 4 instead of 5 stars. also they will trash talk you in creole if they think you don't understand the language.  (but I go for pastries not to make friends.

Name: Holly Crab; Review: I came on a weekday for dinner and there were plenty of seating so my party of 7 was seated immediately. The service was pretty good and the food came out at a reasonable time so it didn't take too long to wait for the food.  The seafood that comes in bags are what they're known for so I got shrimp, snow crab legs, and clams. I tried the Holly sauce and the Sweet Holly sauce. The sweet Holly sauce was actually really good. They also give free baguette bread that you can use to dip in the sauce and it's perfect because it soaks up the juices from the sauce. It would be better if the baguettes were warmed up though. You can also get rice and have it over rice which is also good. The shrimp didn't come out of the shell smoothly, sadly, but everything else was good.  As for some additional foods: - Cheesy noodles were decent but not as good as I hoped. It was kind of greasy. - Their wings are super crispy and very juicy. But, they were small pieces of wings so not a lot of meat in it and didn't have a lot of sauce covering it. - The boneless breasts were pretty good too. Like the wings, it was really crispy and the pieces were pretty thin. - Cajun Fries were good. A bit spicy for those not tolerant to spice.  Overall, a great seafood boil spot that also serves nice Korean style fried chicken! It's definitely a good spot to come with friends to share food and socialize as you eat messily together. At the end of your meal, you might feel a bit greasy from all the sauce settling in but it's a good experience and tasty"
Are there Brazilian food options?,"Name: Brazilian Steak Grill; Review: This Experience was Unique!  Please read and share in the joy. When we decide to visit a restaurant we take a chance hoping the experience will be positive. My Fiancee and I are very adventurous and in fact it was I who chose Brazilian Steak Grill this time.  I am a resident of Marlborough and one day coming back from Home Depot I saw this restaurant but never stopped in. I knew it was there but never stopped in. This time it was different altogether.  As a Baby, I was given up for adoption back in 1963. I never knew my biological parents and I never knew if I had brothers or sisters. It so happens that I did a DNA test and I started to reconnect with cousins BUT in the process I found my long lost sister.  My Sisters name is Almitra, her husband Brent bought her a wedding anniversary gift, a trip to meet the brother she never knew she had. So we got together, we met and I decided to bring us to Brazilian Steak Grill Restaurant.  We entered the restaurant and were received warmly by the owner himself. The wonderful thing was that he took the time to explain all of the ingredients in his buffet display. Americans don't know much about Brazilian Cuisine but he gave us a crash course. He explained the different types of grilled steak, pork, chicken, sausage and more.  The owner made us feel welcome, important, valued and appreciated. In fact he made us feel like family. I later explained how symbolic the visit was to me, my sister and my family for being there.  Long story short. This is a wonderful establishment to eat at. The staff is friendly, the food is fresh and well cooked and you can taste the Brazilian Love and Hospitality.  We are extremely grateful to him, his staff and the Love we felt going there.  Come and enjoy our experience. A feeling of Family coming together.  Muinto Obrigado Gente. Deus t Abençoe abundantemente.  Enjoy Brazil on a plate
Name: Brazilian Steak Grill; Review: It is the best Brazilian restaurant I have ever gone to so far. It is family owned, the food is delicious with no preservatives, there are lots of varieties including vegetables/salads, some of which are very healthy, and the meat is very tender and juicy. The staff is very friendly, warm, and courteous, and the service is outstanding. When my husband and I came in, we were greeted by a very nice young lady, Carole, and Ed, the owner, also greeted us and brought us a complimentary and delicious dessert (Pudim/flan) when we were done eating. We actually found out from him that the food is home made and there are no preservatives added. When it comes to the price, it is very reasonable and affordable. I highly recommend Brazilian Steak Grill and I would give this place more than 5 stars if I could
Name: Labaredas Brazilian BBQ & Bar; Review: I don’t know how I haven’t posted a review yet! I’m from Worcester & I’ve been waiting for a place that serves good Brazilian food & cocktails to open up like this one!  I’ve been coming here once a week on the weekends & each time bringing different people with us to show them this amazing place😄  The food here is delicious & the cocktails are so well made. (Get the Açaí You Next Tuesday or the Pisco Disco - SO GOOD!) Portions are generous. Everyone here is so friendly. My husband & I are definitely going to become regulars here

In early October 2018, my wife and I were guests at the Westin Copley Place Hotel in Boston, MA.  While the hotel lived up to its reputation as one of the best in the city, the true gem within its doors is FOGO DE CHAO BRAZILIAN STEAKHOUSE.  The food, staff, and service is the best we have received during our numerous travels.  The staff was obviously professionally trained to ensure its customers feel they are valued and important.  The menu choices were so diversified and the food was so delicious, we ate in the restaurant or had appetizers at the bar three (3) of our four (4) night’s stay at the hotel. However, great food, which FOGO DE CHAO definitely has and poor service will not make customers return.  FOGO DE CHAO has GREAT FOOD and GREAT SERVICE!!! Therefore, I want to make special mention of three employees we met and who should be recognized by the corporate offices that owns FOGO DE CHAO BRAZILIAN STEAKHOUSE.  First, the bartender, (Saylor) (sp.), who made the most flavorful drinks we’ve had in a long time.  He was accommodating, patient and knowledgeable ensuring we understood the options and making the perfect drink.  Next was our server, Kimberly Zambrando.  She is highly qualified, pays attention to detail and made us feel like we were the only customers in the restaurant.  She was so wonderful we turned to another table and asked how they felt about her service.  They were equally pleased with her ability to please her customers.  Lastly, and we think one of the most important links in the chain of quality was our manager, Maicon Delfino.  He introduced himself the first night we visited the restaurant.  I have met many managers during my visits to restaurants, but Mr. Delfino was one of the few that was warm, knew our name, and asked thoughtful questions stating we should ask for him if we needed anything or wanted to share our experience at the restaurant good or bad.   He greeted us by name each time we went back to the restaurant or bar during our stay. Again, we hope the corporate offices that owns FOGO DE CHAO makes note of this review.  Mr. Delfino (manager), Ms. Zambrando (server), Mr. Saylor (bartender) should be on their radar as the best of the staff at the FOGO DE CHAO BRAZILIAN STEAKHOUSE in the Westin Copley Place Hotel in Boston, MA","Name: Brazilian Steak Grill; Review: I recently moved to Marlborough, and have been checking out some of the many Brazilian restaurants in the area. When I came to this nondescript place last week, I was skeptical at first, but it had several 5-star reviews. I'm now eager to add my own.  This is one of those places that doesn't need any frills or fancy signs because they have great service and excellent food. The buffet provides a good assortment of side items: vegetables, beans, rice, etc. But, the main draw of a Brazilian place is the meat, and theirs is heaven. I tried pork sausage, short ribs, and two different kinds of steak. Each bite was a treasure.  You may pay a little more than at other places, but you won't taste anything better than what you find here. I've found my new favorite restaurant

The salad and side bar with it's different dishes is a great meal in and of itself but of course you must taste the excellent grilled steak - cooked to perfection!  There is also Braised beef, Bacon wrapped chicken and sausages. And PLEASE don't forget the crispy pork, YUMMY!   You will need to take home an order of the most luscious Flan if you have no more room in your belly, which is normally the case for me
Name: Labaredas Brazilian BBQ & Bar; Review: Heard about the new ownership and wanted to give the place some support. Very glad I did.  I went on a Wednesday with my fiance and a couple friends from the area. They had a special for $9 burgers, which three of us got, and I was shocked at the size of it (huge). It was fantastic and a lot different than a burger you'd get at your typical dine in restaurant. Could not recommend enough.  My fiance was the outlier and got the Brazilian steak, of which I had some. Immediately wished I had gotten that. Not to say the burger was not amazing (it was), but the taste on the steak had me wanting more. Definitely going to get that the next time I come.  We had brigadeiro for dessert, which the new owner brought over and said was created with his mother's secret recipe. Admittedly, I have never had brigadeiro before but I would absolutely have it again.  Service was great and the beer tap was excellent. They even had Maine Lunch on tap for any beer aficionados.  Highly recommend giving it a try
Name: Brazilian Steak Grill; Review: This Experience was Unique!  Please read and share in the joy. When we decide to visit a restaurant we take a chance hoping the experience will be positive. My Fiancee and I are very adventurous and in fact it was I who chose Brazilian Steak Grill this time.  I am a resident of Marlborough and one day coming back from Home Depot I saw this restaurant but never stopped in. I knew it was there but never stopped in. This time it was different altogether.  As a Baby, I was given up for adoption back in 1963. I never knew my biological parents and I never knew if I had brothers or sisters. It so happens that I did a DNA test and I started to reconnect with cousins BUT in the process I found my long lost sister.  My Sisters name is Almitra, her husband Brent bought her a wedding anniversary gift, a trip to meet the brother she never knew she had. So we got together, we met and I decided to bring us to Brazilian Steak Grill Restaurant.  We entered the restaurant and were received warmly by the owner himself. The wonderful thing was that he took the time to explain all of the ingredients in his buffet display. Americans don't know much about Brazilian Cuisine but he gave us a crash course. He explained the different types of grilled steak, pork, chicken, sausage and more.  The owner made us feel welcome, important, valued and appreciated. In fact he made us feel like family. I later explained how symbolic the visit was to me, my sister and my family for being there.  Long story short. This is a wonderful establishment to eat at. The staff is friendly, the food is fresh and well cooked and you can taste the Brazilian Love and Hospitality.  We are extremely grateful to him, his staff and the Love we felt going there.  Come and enjoy our experience. A feeling of Family coming together.  Muinto Obrigado Gente. Deus t Abençoe abundantemente.  Enjoy Brazil on a plate
Name: Fogo de Chão Brazilian Steakhouse; Review: I've been a pretty active Yelper for the past couple of years, but that took a turn recently because I've been on keto. This is a high fat, high protein, and very, very low carb diet, making it hard to go to so many restaurants. Having eaten at Five Guys, McDonalds, Wendy's, Shake Shack, Subway, and Boston Burger Company to the point of their cashiers knowing my weird breadless orders, I knew it was time to look for a new keto-friendly restaurant in Boston. And that is how I came across Fogo de Chao, a restaurant I've passed by in many states, but this location in particular, probably 100+ times! WHY HAVE I NEVER WALKED IN BEFORE? I have been missing out on greatness for far too long.  For $52, you can eat all the pork ribs, filet mignon, pork sausage, lamb, sirloin, ribs, chicken, pork loin, meat, meat, and did I forget to mention, MEAT, that your heart desires. EVERYTHING tastes good. I ""accidentally"" left my coaster up on the table, indicating I wanted servers to swing by with food, and in doing so, I tried absolutely everything! I probably ate two full pounds of meat by the end of the night... But there were no regrets (partial lie: I went to the gym to try to walk off the fully belly but even two miles in, I was bloated). You ask for medium rare? You get medium rare. The textures were perfect, to my delight. I never got a piece of ""bad"" meat that night. The seasoning really fluctuates, but it makes for nice variety.  The bar is nice for those who want sides, they've got salad, cheese, cold meats, maple pepper bacon, fruits, soup, veggies, yeah the whole she-bang! The selection is awesome and like the meat, you can eat as much of this stuff as you want.  To top things off, they have awesome drinks and service, and the decor and location are gorgeous.  Next time I'm going, I'll purposefully starve until I arrive to eat as much as I can. Count on me to be that person","Name: Brazilian Steak Grill; Review: I recently moved to Marlborough, and have been checking out some of the many Brazilian restaurants in the area. When I came to this nondescript place last week, I was skeptical at first, but it had several 5-star reviews. I'm now eager to add my own.  This is one of those places that doesn't need any frills or fancy signs because they have great service and excellent food. The buffet provides a good assortment of side items: vegetables, beans, rice, etc. But, the main draw of a Brazilian place is the meat, and theirs is heaven. I tried pork sausage, short ribs, and two different kinds of steak. Each bite was a treasure.  You may pay a little more than at other places, but you won't taste anything better than what you find here. I've found my new favorite restaurant

It is family owned, the food is delicious with no preservatives, there are lots of varieties including vegetables/salads, some of which are very healthy, and the meat is very tender and juicy. The staff is very friendly, warm, and courteous, and the service is outstanding. When my husband and I came in, we were greeted by a very nice young lady, Carole, and Ed, the owner, also greeted us and brought us a complimentary and delicious dessert (Pudim/flan) when we were done eating. We actually found out from him that the food is home made and there are no preservatives added. When it comes to the price, it is very reasonable and affordable. I highly recommend Brazilian Steak Grill and I would give this place more than 5 stars if I could

Name: Casa Romero; Review: Came here for a very early dinner around 5 PM on a Sunday. This place is accessible via an alley and the first thing you noticed the beautiful door. You walk downstairs to a heavily-decorated Mexican restaurant with all the decor from Mexico. It has a very traditional Mexican restaurant feel.  FOOD: Seemed to be a little bit more authentic than your average Mexican food restaurant. We realized that since we arrived before 6 and would leave by 7 that we could order the early bird special which has 3 courses for $24. I was hungry so I went for it.  Marinated Chicken Wings with Mole Sauce - These chicken wings were on the fattier side but the sauce was rich and delicious. This also came with fried plantains on top which was a nice sweet element. I LOVE fried plantains.  Pulled Roasted Pork (aka Cochinita Pibil) - SO delicious. Perfect balance of a little spicy with very savory. The meat was so tender. I wish I could have eaten this all night.  Mexican-Style Crepes - not sure what makes this Mexican besides the caramel on top but this is also filled with sliced bananas. Came with a side of vanilla ice cream. Delicious and wish I had more.  Portions were on the smaller side compared to other Mexican restaurants, though that may have been because it was part of the early bird special. I would definitely come back for the early bird special.  Tip: If you order before 6 and leave before 7, get the early bird special. $24 for 3 courses. What a deal! Keep that in mind if you are hungry one afternoon in Back Bay

Caribbean cuisine nearby,"Name: Caribbean Flavors (Boston); Review: Great workers, good service. I ordered food and it was delivered in 30 mins absolutely found a new daily food spot.

Name: The Hungry I; Review: For anniversary we wanted French cuisine we thought this place would be romantic and although it does have a romantic atmosphere the entry way to get into the actual restaurant is not well marked and you walk through an alleyway very small restaurant but we ate on the terrorist we should have known something was up when we walked in and it had been open for 40 minutes and no one was there the waiter was nice but the food was mot French cuisine as expected maybe a few items but mostly American food extremely limited menu extremely overpriced I wanted French cuisine something that I couldn't make at home everything we ate I could have made at home place is overrated and overpriced will not returne
Name: Island Style; Review: Heard so much about this place and was finally able to try it. I love the fact that the restaurant reminds me so much of home with a Caribbean feel. I’m thankful for the young lady who was able to help me choose a meal. She was also able to help me choose an alternative to what they had for my daughter who is vegetarian.  Thank you so much Fabie we will be back
Name: Flames Restaurant II; Review: Food: 4 Service: 1.5  In terms of quality & consistency, Flames meets the bar. The beef patties and coco bread are good enough (though the beef is often minced to the consistency of baby food). The shrimp is by far a favorite because it is always well-cooked (technique), flavorful and succulent. The curries, stews etc. are not so far Americanized that they are not recognizable.  That's where the compliments end...  If you like condescension, near-bullying, quasi-elitism, xenophobia and general misanthropy- then Flames is for you.  The staff are brusque, unnecessarily supercilious and generally impolite. If you present with a Caribbean accent, or have the thick skin of a rhino, you may fair alright.  From arbitrary policies regarding dine in, often unreasonable wait times and seemingly ever-climbing prices, this place is best suited for those who crave fast & consistent Caribbean food, can't cook it (well) and/or masochists.  So, good luck","Name: Caribe Restaurant; Review: Good place to eat, good hygiene, they deliver, Hispanic food, fresh seafood, mofongo etc.

Name: Country Kitchen; Review: Love the authenticity of the flavor. The jerk chicken is a must have seeing that they smoke their chicken year round on an original Jamaican made smoker. If you love seafood and spice the drunken crab will have you begging for another visit.

Name: Tropical Island; Review: Tropical Island restaurant is a restaurant that specializes in cuisine from the Dominican Republic. The portion sizes are huge and you can expect to get all of your favorites if you have ever had Dominican cuisine. It is not a sit down restaurant, mainly focusing on takeout (every plate that is ordered is placed in a to-go container). There is no elaborate menu, the process is if you have any questions ask the person serving you the food to explain what the dish may be. The food is good quality and it is an great place to get takeout. It is not a place you would consider taking the entire family for a sit down meal, though if you are stopping by for lunch at work and don't want to eat in the office there is space available to dine. The major draw of Tropical Island is the portion size. It is one of the few places remaining where an adult can get a pretty hearty meal for under $7, and typically if you get anything larger you will need to save the food for the next day

Name: Blue Mountain; Review: I stopped by today and was greeted with friendly customer service. I had read the article of Boston's top Caribbean and ethnic food restaurants and this place came up, and let me tell you.....IT DID NOT disappoint! The food was excellent. (A little more high end then I'm used to) but none the less I enjoyed my items. The food was flavorful and far from flat. The only thing was some of the food items such as the curry chicken and jerk chicken I had a difficult time identifying some of the flavors such as pemento. However the spice was there.(and it was fantastic) To me this resurant lives up to its Blue Mountain name and I'd highly recommend. Thanks Blue Mountain for serving me fine Jamaican cusine!!!!

Name: Manà Escondido Cafe; Review: This is truly a hidden gem, tucked in a cross street just close enough to be seen driving by Tremont I happened to glanced at it one lucky day. I do construction work and whenever I’m in the area I stop by to have some home cooked caribbean food. Super well seasoned to my taste, they make food to go that reminds me of my home country. My suggestion is the Chicharron, beef stew and yucca. Very affordable prices

Name: Raphael's Restaurant; Review: OMG!!! The food here is amazingly good.  It's a 10 out of 10.  I have never been disappointed with anything that I've ordered and I've eaten here at least 15 times.  Everything is authentically and deliciously seasoned and extremely flavorful. The deco & service is on the mediocre side but who cares when the food is so exceptional ( especially, in comparison to all the other ""Jamaican/Caribbean"" food spots in a ten mile a radius of this place)!

Name: Oliveira's Restaurant E Boston; Review: Not worth the hype! I was given a dirty scratched up plate. The food is over priced knowing I can get the same plate of food at a Caribbean or Spanish restaurant for $12 or make my self for free... $31 for regular white rice and beans and plantains and dry steak? Really?. This restaurant is for people who are used to eating bland and unseasoned foods and need to ease their way into eating ethnic foods. Simply mediocre. Don’t get me started with the to go plate system I have to PAY for MY left overs on top of the original price!? You guys are THIEVES

Name: Mofongo House Restaurant; Review: The Mofongo House offers a variety of delicious Dominican and Latin food specialties. The ambience is welcoming, cozy, tropical and happy. Its also, the perfect restaurant to visit with the family, a date or meeting with friends to enjoy an ice cold Presidente beer. Highly recommend the traditional Mofongo de Pollo. I Love it. The servers and the management team treated me and my family with excellent service. Great job"
Where can I find tapas?,"Name: Bin 26 Enoteca; Review: We went here on a recommendation. We thought by looking at the menu outside, the prices were reasonable. Once seated, the waiter informed us the menu is tapas style. Unless we missed this, there was no mention outside of this restaurant serving tapas style.  The food itself was average. The garden salad was just a mix of greens and my ricotta gnocchi in cream sauce was fair. Bread and oil are served with your meal.  On a positive note, the staff (host and servers) were very welcoming and friendly. The wine we had was great and the selection of wines were plentiful
Name: La Catrina - Mexican Food; Review: This place always surpasses my expectations. Recently, I brought guests from out of town to a tapas place nearby here. In the past two weeks, the tapas place apparently got new management and a lot has changed. Needless to say, we left that restaurant dissatisfied and still hungry. We were looking for something to fill this void, and saw a “Taco Tuesday” sign outside of La Catrina and said “why not?” We not only received great food and drinks, but also great service for such a packed restaurant. The waitress even went to 7-Eleven when they ran out of Sprite for a mixed drink we ordered. Also, we got guacamole to go which tasted fresh and delicious. This whole meal hit the spot after such an anticlimactic and underwhelming dining experience  from the other restaurant close by. I love this place and always forget how great it is. Will be going back very soon
Name: Society on High; Review: There's some identity confusion going in here. Tapas, but not necessarily Spanish influenced. The dumplings we're deep fried, not pan fried (yes I said dumplings in the sentence after tapas). The lamb chops okay, overcooked to be honest. Got one chip and one end piece...wawaeaaa. good oysters, foie gras was good, roasted brussel sprouts were undercooked, blackened on the cut face only, slimy on the shell.... Service, great. Great attention to us. Good atmosphere. A lot going for this place, get your consistency back. Those plates were probably not served the way they were intended
Name: La Casa de Pedro Rapido; Review: This place is overpriced and just okay. At $18.50, My husband's lunch Cubano was tasty and large enough to save half for a later meal, so not too bad. But I ordered a $14.50 lunch portion salad with chicken and avocado and only got 3 tiny slices of avocado - less than 1/8 of an avocado. The chicken was more generous and tasted good, but I found a small bone. But my biggest complaint is definitely the prices. They had a tapas and ceviche menu that we didn't dare order from because the tapas start at ~$10 each and the ceviches start at ~$15 each, and we were advised each person should order 2-3 items. Rip off. The entree menu was also overpriced. There also was no pre-meal snacks like chips or salsa like you would typically have at Latin inspired restaurants. I don't expect this restaurant to last long in the area
Name: Porto; Review: While many restaurants are small in this area, and impossible to get a table, Porto is crowded and busy, but there were tables/bar options when I went and the staff worked to accomodate my group. The tapas style is more unique than traditional courses, but it did encourage sharing and they have options that include meat, vegetables, and fresh seafood, to please your entire group.  The flavors are recognizable but with little well-curated notes of citrus, nuts, or hot pepper. I was a big fan of their lobster wrap and their scallop ceviche; my fiance does not eat scallops and yet loved this. Service was quick, even for the entire branzino that was ordered. The only issue I had is that my octopus was chewy. Across over 10 different tapas/entrees, everything else was superb along with the service and my cocktail. Do note, this restaurant is on the pricier side as my friend exclaimed later, ""$9 for a lampchop?!?!?,"" but I found it worth the price","Name: Estragon Tapas; Review: Smell is principal to taste. When the smoked paprika - sweet, caressing, warmth - hits your nose it's a done deal: one relaxes into the feast of small plates delivering the biggest of flavors. The shishito peppers are just better here because (freshness?), (the evoo?), (the smoky element?), (the flaked flor de sal?). I'm a fan of morcilla as Boston's Puerto Rican community introduced me to it. Here at Estragón, they do it quite to my liking: some heat and crispy where it should be.  I prefer croquetas de bacalao to be more clearly, declaratively fishy-salt-cod than the creamy offering here. On the positive side, their crunch was perfect as was the crispness of the patátas bravas.  When chef/owner, Julio de Haro, carves Jamón Ibérico de Bellota from the ham holder and regales in his childhood stories of food, love, and technique, that meat-butter, served at the perfect temperature, melts in your mouth better, tastes better, is a more complete sensual experience.  I like tapas here more than anywhere else. I'm glad it's not a ""scene""... yet..
Name: Tapeo; Review: I love this place - eat at the bar for cheaper prices!  I went here 10 years ago and fell in love with the place. I take my friends there whenever we travel to Boston and they love it as well. Although its not that same as 10 years ago I still love it.  We usually eat at the bar and get several of the $5 and $7 tapas plates and a pitcher of Sangria (usually more than one). Beware the sangria is strong (which is why I like it). The staff is always nice and actually speak spanish. Note that there are only about 12 or so seats at the bar so you may need to eat at the tables and pay full-price
Name: Tapeo; Review: This place is fine... Nothing spectacular or memorable. The spinach dish was fresh spinach which was nice and the cheese with honey was good. The sangria was sweet (and they couldn't transfer or bar bill to our dinner table which was odd since they told us to wait at the bar).  The ambience was odd-super bright overhead lighting until we asked them to turn it down. The waiter was fine. The hostesses looked confused when we asked for a table and took a few minutes to get their bearings. The bartender was actually the friendliest of the staff.  With so many tapas joints in town, I'd recommend Barcelona for a similar price point--though you need a resi there and Tapeo took us as walk ins
Name: Barcelona Wine Bar; Review: Having been to Spain a couple times and dined at a number of tapas and paella restaurants there, I can say that Barcelona Wine Bar is pretty authentic. My boyfriend and I came at 9pm on Sunday, and true to the Spanish custom of dining late, dinner was still bustling. Unfortunately, some dishes, like the octopus, were sold out, but mostly we were able to get what we wanted.  Charcuterie platter: We got a soft goat cheese, salami, and jamón serrano. All were delightful. The meats has just the right amount of fat and weren't overwhelmingly salty, and the cheese had a nice touch of tangyness and goatyness.  Paella de mariscos: We shared a paella for one between the two of us, and it was more than enough. The rice was a little hard and crunchy with ample wetness, which I liked. There were lots of onions and peppers in the dish though, which may or may not be to your liking.  Crispy beef tendon: Interesting but wouldn't order again. Wasn't that flavorful.  Duck confit salad: I just wanted some greens to balance the meal out, and this salad did the trick.  Albondigas (meatballs): Amazing! Juicy and full of tomato flavor. Loved the chunky ham and tomato sauce. Couldn't tell whether the stringy bits inside the meatballs were cheese, and as a lactose intolerant person, I'd rather not know.  Wine: I really enjoyed my Zarel-lo white wine.  Bread: Amazing. Probably one of the best parts of the meal. Warm, crunchy crust, soft and moist interior. Would buy this bread if they sold it.  The service was a bit flustered. Wasn't a huge fan of the waiter mansplaining tapas to me, and the server who poured our wine didn't give us a taste before pouring the glass. We also had to ask several times for oil for the bread
Name: Estragon Tapas; Review: Came for restaurant week. Our server said he had worked there for years and knew the menu in and out  and could answer any and all questions which was great.  I got the fried octopus, fried squid and garlic shrimp. Seafood kick much? The octopus was fried perfectly, but some pieces were too big so they were squishy. The squid rings were half cooked perfectly, and I only liked one of the sauces (the yellow one). The red one was strange...I wish I knew what they were. And the shrimp was PERFECT. I wish I could have eaten all of them, but it was so much food already...I did stuff more in my face than I should have though. I got the flan, which was good but not really rememberable after everything else.  One plate we ordered came out pretty late, so we got an extra one for free. I couldn't eat it, but my friend said it was great.  The sangria was good, good taste of wine with alcohol mixed in and bits of fruit. Sometimes you don't get all of that and it's just wine with fruit","Name: Estragon Tapas; Review: Smell is principal to taste. When the smoked paprika - sweet, caressing, warmth - hits your nose it's a done deal: one relaxes into the feast of small plates delivering the biggest of flavors. The shishito peppers are just better here because (freshness?), (the evoo?), (the smoky element?), (the flaked flor de sal?). I'm a fan of morcilla as Boston's Puerto Rican community introduced me to it. Here at Estragón, they do it quite to my liking: some heat and crispy where it should be.  I prefer croquetas de bacalao to be more clearly, declaratively fishy-salt-cod than the creamy offering here. On the positive side, their crunch was perfect as was the crispness of the patátas bravas.  When chef/owner, Julio de Haro, carves Jamón Ibérico de Bellota from the ham holder and regales in his childhood stories of food, love, and technique, that meat-butter, served at the perfect temperature, melts in your mouth better, tastes better, is a more complete sensual experience.  I like tapas here more than anywhere else. I'm glad it's not a ""scene""... yet..

Name: Tapeo; Review: I love this place - eat at the bar for cheaper prices!  I went here 10 years ago and fell in love with the place. I take my friends there whenever we travel to Boston and they love it as well. Although its not that same as 10 years ago I still love it.  We usually eat at the bar and get several of the $5 and $7 tapas plates and a pitcher of Sangria (usually more than one). Beware the sangria is strong (which is why I like it). The staff is always nice and actually speak spanish. Note that there are only about 12 or so seats at the bar so you may need to eat at the tables and pay full-price

Name: Tapeo; Review: This place is fine... Nothing spectacular or memorable. The spinach dish was fresh spinach which was nice and the cheese with honey was good. The sangria was sweet (and they couldn't transfer or bar bill to our dinner table which was odd since they told us to wait at the bar).  The ambience was odd-super bright overhead lighting until we asked them to turn it down. The waiter was fine. The hostesses looked confused when we asked for a table and took a few minutes to get their bearings. The bartender was actually the friendliest of the staff.  With so many tapas joints in town, I'd recommend Barcelona for a similar price point--though you need a resi there and Tapeo took us as walk ins

Name: Barcelona Wine Bar; Review: Having been to Spain a couple times and dined at a number of tapas and paella restaurants there, I can say that Barcelona Wine Bar is pretty authentic. My boyfriend and I came at 9pm on Sunday, and true to the Spanish custom of dining late, dinner was still bustling. Unfortunately, some dishes, like the octopus, were sold out, but mostly we were able to get what we wanted.  Charcuterie platter: We got a soft goat cheese, salami, and jamón serrano. All were delightful. The meats has just the right amount of fat and weren't overwhelmingly salty, and the cheese had a nice touch of tangyness and goatyness.  Paella de mariscos: We shared a paella for one between the two of us, and it was more than enough. The rice was a little hard and crunchy with ample wetness, which I liked. There were lots of onions and peppers in the dish though, which may or may not be to your liking.  Crispy beef tendon: Interesting but wouldn't order again. Wasn't that flavorful.  Duck confit salad: I just wanted some greens to balance the meal out, and this salad did the trick.  Albondigas (meatballs): Amazing! Juicy and full of tomato flavor. Loved the chunky ham and tomato sauce. Couldn't tell whether the stringy bits inside the meatballs were cheese, and as a lactose intolerant person, I'd rather not know.

Name: Estragon Tapas; Review: The welcome was exceptional... seated in the lounge area in back... seated on the comfy sofa to eat tapas was the best! We had... (1) fried chick peas (delicious! ...but I think they are a wee bit overpriced for the size bowl you get), (2) shishito peppers (well cooked, but not well seasoned... some got hit with salt, some not), (3) tomato/garlic toast (really shouldn't buy tomatoes out of season, and they were under-seasoned... the toast was really good - in spots - some parts of the bread were yummy, other parts kind of plain), (4) garlic shrimp (cooked perfectly, great garlic sauce with a little heat in it), (5) vegetables with romesco (hit and miss again on the seasoning of the veggies, and the eggplant was kind of rubbery/chewy... the romesco sauce was delicious), (6) patatas bravas (I liked them, my wife thought the sauce tasted too much like spicy catsup), and chicken empanadillos (with the shrimp, one of the two best dishes if the meal). Given the notes... nothing was bad, but the seasoning of the food was uneven. For example, in the veggie/romesco dish, one slice of squash was fantastic, the next one, so-so. We will go back and try some other dishes, and either avoid the ones we were conflicted about or - in the case of the veggie dish - ask for it to be made to order (without eggplant). Mostly, I just would like too see better attention to making sure that all of the food is seasoned evenly. One more thing... the guy working the front of house (damn, forgot his name)... really excellent work, and I'll never want to sit anywhere but on the sofa in back ever again (thank you for that!!!)","Name: Tapeo; Review: I love this place - eat at the bar for cheaper prices!

Name: PURO ceviche bar; Review: Best meal of 2019 and it’s December!!  😋⚡️  Not even exaggerating, EVERYTHING about this place is wonderful. Every single tapa was delicious and not teeny tiny like another tapas place that starts with a B 😳Drinks were superb and crafted. Service was chill and speedy.  I’m hesitant to write this review because I want to be a secret Boston gem 😏  We ate: • the ceviche with passion fruit (the flavor depth is insane) • patatas bravas (amazing sauce) • elote (nommmm) • drinks on drinks  Keep doing what y’all are doing

Name: El Morro Restaurant; Review: Service was amazing! Raquel explained the menu to my non Spanish speaking friends and they were delighted with her service. The food was very tasteful. The prices were on point for a restaurant setting. The atmosphere was great...the music incredibly great!!! This is not a quick take out place this is an actual restaurant that is open till 1am. This restaurant was very much needed. I will definitely go back & recommend this place

Name: La Casa de Pedro Rapido; Review: This place is overpriced and just okay. At $18.50, My husband's lunch Cubano was tasty and large enough to save half for a later meal, so not too bad. But I ordered a $14.50 lunch portion salad with chicken and avocado and only got 3 tiny slices of avocado - less than 1/8 of an avocado. The chicken was more generous and tasted good, but I found a small bone. But my biggest complaint is definitely the prices. They had a tapas and ceviche menu that we didn't dare order from because the tapas start at ~$10 each and the ceviches start at ~$15 each, and we were advised each person should order 2-3 items. Rip off. The entree menu was also overpriced. There also was no pre-meal snacks like chips or salsa like you would typically have at Latin inspired restaurants. I don't expect this restaurant to last long in the area"
Turkish restaurants around here,"Name: Turkish Lazuri Café; Review: This gem just opened up in my neighborhood.  The service is amazing, the staff are friendly and welcoming.  The menu (most, maybe all, Halal) has a variety of Turkish, American, and Italian dishes.  They offer a full breakfast menu, appetizers, entrees, sides, and an enticing array of homemade desserts, including THREE different types of, “made fresh, this morning, by Mom”, baklava.  Beverages include Turkish Tea and Turkish coffee.  This place is such a delight.  It has definitely earned a place in our dine in and take-out rotation
Name: Café de Boston; Review: It is a very big restaurant with many varieties. You can make your own pasta. You can make your plate from the cold bar (it is 30% off after 2:30). I returned and bought Turkish coffee. Doner kebab was good. Turkish coffee is already the same as in Turkey. A spacious place. It is very easy in transportation. I met an authorized Turkish sister there, but unfortunately I forgot her name now. The room restaurant introduced me and gave information. He said that they keep the website updated in terms of menu every day. They were not open on weekends because their workplaces were closed.
Name: Sultan's Kitchen; Review: Big fan of Sultan's Kichen - quick, fast, delicious Turkish food in the heart of the Financial District. They're open on Saturdays, which makes for a stellar post-gym lunch. Their menu is endless and includes an array of vegetarian options (at least 10 different veggie mezes) as well as chicken, pork, lamb, and all sorts of meat. If you're in the mood for a home-cooked Turkish meal, this comes pretty close. Two things against Sultan's Kitchen - credit card minimum of $9 and food is a bit overpriced
Name: Saray Restaurant‎; Review: This is a tough one. I thought the food was good but our Turkish exchange student says it was just OK. Our server seemed disinterested. And, the restaurant is old and rather dingy, giving the feeling that it wasn't as clean as it could be. So...   meh
Name: Saray Restaurant‎; Review: First of all, there is nothing special about this place. We went there for a dinner with my family. We ordered lentil  soup and their special kabab (vali kebabi) and shepherd salad. The lentil soup was the worst lentil soup that I have ever eaten in the US. All of the other Turkish  restaurants have better soup than this place. The kabab that we ordered was a mixed one in which there were chicken shish, lamb shish, kufte, Adana kabab and doner. Except the chicken none of them has any taste when I compare it with the kababs that I ate in other Turkish restaurants. With all of these, they are really overpriced and they charged me 13.5 dolar for something that  I really don't know. The guy wrote that number to the receipt by hand and I did not want to say anything because I had a guest with me. I don't think I am going to visit that place again","Name: Ali Baba Restaurant Boston; Review: Good authentic Turkish spot.  They speak English, but Turkish is their first language, and the food reflects it... delicious!  I had the Turlu (vegetable stew) $9, comes with Bulghur (rice), Ayran (yoghurt drink) $3 and bread (complimentary). All delicious.  Followed up with Turkish Tea ($2), and that was good as well. Total bill was 14.98 before tip, brought it to $15 with the tip (jk, I tip).  Bathroom is clean, nice floor, and some art work, but you have to go through the kitchen to get there.  They offer nice desserts (see photos) like baklava, and they make Turkish coffee. The have Splenda for your sugar substitute.  I would probably be a regular if I lived or worked near here.  Thumbs up if you appreciate this review
Name: Ali Baba Restaurant Boston; Review: I am a regular customer here. Even though I had great experiences over the years, I had terrible ones as well.  The best dish here is Turkish Doner (gyro). It's made in house. The taste is almost as good as what you can get in Turkey which is not common overseas. Iskender could be better which is made with Doner, however they are weak in its sauce.  Lahmacun (Turkish thin Pizza) and pide is a gamble. If the owner is in, you will get the best lahmacun and pide you can get in whole North America. If not, you may get the worst one. I literally got sick twice.  Yogurt is another gamble item. They prepare yogurt in house. It is sometimes really good, and the other times is terribly sour. I believe this is because of lack of refrigeration as yogurt gets sour if you leave it in warmer place.  Iskembe soup is acceptably good consistently. However kelle paca soup is not. The last two times I tried it, I had to send it back. It was so bad that there was a bacterial smell in it.  The service is good and bad depending on who is working which is common in restaurants this size. The waiters are mostly amateurs who are students which is common as well.  Overall, this is an OK place to visit if it is a late night option. They are open late at night, sometimes until 3 in the morning. Unfortunately  I can only vote three stars due to the inconsistent food quality

Have called the store multiple times to speak with a manager, but there never seems to be one on duty. They absolutely need new staff. The waitresses are extremely rude, absolutely no greeting when first entering the store, the wait time is too long, they do not even ask if the food served to the customers is liked or even if they need something to drink. Last night was the last time I visit this place and spend the money for that poor of a service. I asked the waitress why she always looks angry and her answer was: “Because you are complaining.” As a customer I have all the rights to want fresh- hot served food and I don’t prefer the main dish when I haven’t even gotten my appetizers yet. I ordered a soup and lahmajun and not only I had to wait 30 minutes for a bowl of soup which they already had it made prior on the day, but she had the nerve to just slam the main dish plate on the table and not even give us a glance or recognize her customer. Lastly, I gave her the money and was planning on not tipping her just to get back less money because she already kept a tip for herself. Absolutely not recommending this place to any families or parents with children because they cook with no gloves as they scratch their sweaty face and constantly go smoking outside then go back to cook

Name: Basho Sushi; Review: Good sushi good price
Name: Ginza Japanese; Review: Great place for Boston Sushi
Name: LoLa 42 Boston; Review: If I could give negative start, I would. Your overpriced sushi taste similar or worst than a cheap supermarket sushi. You should change your chef, because he/she obviously doesn't know what the real sushi taste like. I would never mind paying the  fancy price for a good food, but let's face the fact that your food doesn't deserve the price. I've been to many upscale sushi restaurants around the world, noting taste as awful as your sushi, especially for the price, 3 rolls + miso soup for $120.. Ridiculous for the quality. I would not pay $5 for your sushi, if I only knew it would be this awful
Name: Symphony Sushi; Review: Every time I go to a new restaurant, I try to find the menu item that'll be my go-to in the future. Symphony Sushi is very close to where I live, and it has been for years now, so of course it has preference over other sushi places for that reason. Time and time again I've tried to find something, anything on the menu that I think is actually worth ordering again. I haven't found a single thing. I've ordered something different almost every time I've gone, and nothing has taken my heart. Everything has been perfectly mediocre. I hate to talk about my exes, but back in Albany I had a sushi place called Sushi Tei that I was absolutely smitten with. The prices were good, and the sushi was so tasty it was unreal. But Albany isn't known for its sushi, so I figured a city like Boston would have its standards a lot higher, right? Symphony Sushi hasn't given me anything that's measured up, despite my many attempts to give it another chance. If you're just craving sushi in general and you're local like I am, this is your place. But if you want something with more substance, something that'll actually wow you, you'll have to look elsewhere. I'm sorry. :","Name: Lotus Blossom; Review: Update: 2/11/2018. Price for the buffet has increased to $23.50. Sadly, Daniel the bartender's salary has not. Still worth a visit or 12.  I stopped in here after passing for many months to and from work. I finally took a Sunday and went for the sushi buffet. It was fantastic. The selection was great and very delicious and fresh. The hot buffet was equally delicious. Choice of several stuffed dumplings, seasame chicken, noodles, white rice and some daily options. The decor is modern, with classic tables with cloth. I will definitely be stopping by again.

Name: Four Seasons Buffet; Review: I used to love coming here, I would often come with friends after the dinner rush. The food quality wasn't usually great, but we figured it was just from sitting a bit longer since it would be late.  This most recent time I went at about 5:30, assuming the food would be as fresh as possible. Some things, like the fried shrimp were cold on the top from sitting too long without anyone mixing them. The sushi was made in front of me, but the seaweed was soggy and almost chewy. The noodles, rice, and general tso's chicken were all fine but nothing great.  I know it's a buffet, and the food won't be top tier quality, but this just was not very good. I'll likely be back just to give them a second chance, but I'm not very optimistic

Name: Haru Sushi; Review: For special occasion sushi, this is it - service is impeccable, atmosphere pristine, modern and seemingly never too noisy...but the food is the real masterpiece. Wonderfully arranged, each dish comes to you like a little present: and unwrapping bites of Beef Nagamaki, Vegetable Dumplings, and rolls like the Gramercy Park Roll (crunchy spicy super white tune & jalapenos wrapped with tuna, yellowtail and salmon and topped with lemon, cilantro, tobiko and yuzu miso sauce) is the best part. You'll shell out, but it's worth it - and they have very reasonably priced drinks - our table got delicious cocktails for $6 each. Top it off with some mango sorbet and/or green tea ice cream, and you have a perfectly rounded night out
Name: 7 Nana Japanese Steakhouse; Review: Went with my girlfriend in the pm and had the buffet. The sushi is what you'd expect from a restaurant at this price range. I liked it. It wasn't the greatest sushi, but it'll definitely quell your hunger for sushi. The gyōza, a 3pc appetizer, was also good. Fairly well fried n well flavored pork filling. The plate of calamari, fried, was on the thin side n lightly fried with little batter. But still tasted good, especially with the sauce. The veggie udon soup was also well flavored n had a fair balance of veggie and udon noodles (which were served on the good side of Al dente). The pad Thai was garbage. Period. The ice cream, Macha green tea for her and red bean for me, was also enjoyable. The mix drinks we got was not so enjoyable. It was basically sugar syrup and alcohol for $9 bucks a pop. I'm good. The service and employees was by far the best in the whole experience. Attentive, friendly, helpful, knowledgeable. 3 stars because the package, as a whole, wasn't worth $90","Name: Lotus Blossom; Review: Update: 2/11/2018. Price for the buffet has increased to $23.50.

It wasn't the greatest sushi, but it'll definitely quell your hunger for sushi. The gyōza, a 3pc appetizer, was also good. Fairly well fried n well flavored pork filling. The plate of calamari, fried, was on the thin side n lightly fried with little batter. But still tasted good, especially with the sauce. The veggie udon soup was also well flavored n had a fair balance of veggie and udon noodles (which were served on the good side of Al dente). The pad Thai was garbage. Period. The ice cream, Macha green tea for her and red bean for me, was also enjoyable. The mix drinks we got was not so enjoyable. It was basically sugar syrup and alcohol for $9 bucks a pop. I'm good. The service and employees was by far the best in the whole experience. Attentive, friendly, helpful, knowledgeable. 3 stars because the package, as a whole, wasn't worth $90","Name: State Street Sushi; Review: Brand new sushi place that know what they're doing. Amazing sushi at a low price and convenient spot

Name: T Sushi & Noodles; Review: Although at first it would seem like a very simple sushi stand, you would be surprised by how fresh and tasty their rolls are (Spicy salmon)!! They also have a BOGO 50% off from 4-8 pm. Now I can have a great sushi on a work day"
Ramen delivery near me,"Name: Tora Ramen; Review: Amazing ramen! Had a chance to taste good tonkatsu ramen after a long time. I had the kuro tonkatsu ramen which is very good . Probably better than all ramen places I have tried in Boston. The spicy miso ramen was very good too as told by my partner. Something I had never tried before was torched pork belly that came with the ramen and it was melt in mouth. we also ordered a side of kuro karaage which was very crunchy yet moist . Cash only and they accept tips with it
Name: Tao Ramen•Sushi; Review: First time here and I’m definitely coming back. I moved here from Boston and this place is one of the best ramen place I’ve seen so far. Now I don’t have to drive to Boston to get my ramen fix
Name: Tora Ramen; Review: I was here for the soft opening and was pleasantly surprised. I got the shiro ramen with double chashu ramen that was cooked perfectly via the sous vide. Very yummy broth and one of the best soft boiled eggs I’ve had in a long time. Totto ramen comes in a close second. You’ll find me here more often as I plan to try all the different kinds of ramen they offer
Name: Tora Ramen; Review: Great ramen! We went through yelp and found the closest in the top 5 and it did not disappoint. We got the pork dumplings, miso ramen, and shiro ramen. It was all delicious and the staff was pleasant. The covid policies are spot on and they have a bathroom for customers.  Will definitely be back and contemplated going back for lunch tomorrow
Name: Santouka Back Bay; Review: This is a solid Ramen spot that will not disappoint. I stood in line with many others for ~40 min on a cold winter day, and would have happily done it again. There is nothing like sitting down with a piping hot bowl of Ramen on a cold day.  I went with their signature Tonkotsu Shio Ramen, and paired it with their combo deal which is a total no-brainer. For only a few bucks extra the Ramen came with a rice bowl (Cha-Shu Gohan) and a soft boiled egg (Aji-Tama) on the side. I thought the broth of the Ramen was complex and oh so delicious. Personally, I thought the meat in the soup was too fatty which was a distraction from the otherwise great bowl of Ramen. The side dishes were flavorful and paired perfectly with my steaming hot bowl of soup.  This restaurant is pretty small, so if you plan to head this way you better be prepared to wait. That being said, the chefs move quickly and all patrons have food in front of them pretty quickly which really helps the line outdoors to move along. Santouka's location in the Back Bay is a perfect place to take a pit-stop if you are doing some shopping on Newbury or at the Prudential. I'd happily recommend this spot to anyone looking for a good bowl of Ramen","Name: Wen's noodle and Ramen 过桥米线; Review: I usually get orders to go, but some times dine in. I find them to be very reasonably priced, especially considering how much variety their menu has compared to a fair amount ramen places around the city. Good food, never had a bad meal here, my go to for ramen on the go, and close to park st, Boylston and downtown crossing t stops
Name: Amateras Ramen; Review: First, most remarkable was how fast and efficient the service was during Friday lunch hour. Second, don't be put off by the construction outside, I walked past it once before I saw it the second time. Third, this is the first ramen I've tried outside of Chicago that has deighted me as much as my favorite ramen shops in Chi Town (obviously I've never been to Japan).  For the purpose of true comparison I kept it simple: Yokohama Tonkatsu and Pakchee Salad. The broth was rich and complex, just as it should be. The pork was tender. If I were to do it over I would have ordered some extra toppings. Size wise this was a little smaller than I'm used to but I still couldn't finish all the noodles. And the Cold Brew Iced Matcha Green Tea was a nice suprise as I ordered it without looking at the menu and thought I was just getting green tea. They served it with simple syrup on the side but I didn't need it

Name: Wen's Yunnan noodle and Ramen 过桥米线; Review: After putting our name in at another Ramen restaurant nearby (with over an hour wait), we decided to walk the streets in hopes of possibly finding an equally satisfying alternative. After a few minute walk we were able to find Wen.  Most tables were occupied and we were told ten minutes. Another waiter came over and combined to smaller tables to create accommodations for our party of 4. Water was waiting for us at our table which was nice.  The menu is small, but had rice noodle options and Ramen options. They also have a variety of extra things to put in your ramen for a fee. I was discussing my options with my husband when the waiter overhead and kindly clarified and explained one of the menu options better. This was super helpful!  We ordered fried dumplings for an appetizer. Usually when we've gotten them they are pan fried, bit these were deep fried, kind of similar to an empanada. They had a yummy pork filling. It was different than I am used to but delicious.  For my meal I ordered the Barbarian ramen which was beef flank, ramen, potatoes and carrots. When it arrived the portions were pretty good. I was disappointed to find no potatoes and carrots in my soup. And the beef was super fatty and chewy. I also didn't personally care for the spices used in my dish (maybe fennel? Or anise?) I don't like the licorice flavored spices and that's what mine tasted like so I was personally disappointed in my choice.  My husband and friends however were overall pretty happy with their choices. My cousin did have to order extra noodles (at a small cost) because she had a lot of broth left over.  Overall thoughts: service was kind and attentive, food came out very quickly, but a little disappointed overall for the meat quality of the beef. Portions were good and most of the table thought the food was ok-good, not super wowing. I think there are better choices and options in the nearby area
Name: Wen's Yunnan noodle and Ramen 过桥米线; Review: Terrible terrible customer service, not at all respectful! I wouldn't say this place is authentic Yunnan Noodle, but since it's really close to work so I've been ordering here a few times for lunch. I alsways confirm the time for expected wait before ordering. I ordered today and the staff over the phone informed me it will be a 10 min wait, which I accepted it. I arrived to pick up and it's been 15 minutes after I ordered it, it was ready, and they asked me to wait another 2 mins... eventually the total wait time was 30 mins, still no food! I ended up having to cancel both mine and my co-worker's order, wasted 30 mins of our break time, never again coming back here, you just lost a lot of customer in this area! None of us will ever order again!!","Name: Wen's noodle and Ramen 过桥米线; Review: I usually get orders to go, but some times dine in.

Name: Amateras Ramen; Review: The only times I've gone here is at night. They have very fast, attentive, and polite service, but I have never been during a busy time.  The ramen is good. It reminds me of the ramen shops in Japan. Their Yokohama tonkotsu ramen isn't as creamy as the tonkotsu you'll get in a nice shop in Tokyo (what most people think of when they think tonkotsu), but I like it.  They have a few other types, including spicy miso with different levels of spiciness (on the ""specials"" menu).  The menu is very concise and simple. Each ramen type comes with basic toppings, and you can add in as many toppings as you like for an extra $1-$4 each. I like their varied selection of toppings.  I hope this place doesn't make me fat","Name: Tao Ramen•Sushi; Review: First time here and I’m definitely coming back.

Name: Pikaichi; Review: Unbelievable. Best Ramen for the money in New England imo. If you prefer light, their Shio and Yuzu Shio broth is refreshing and flavorful. The Miso and Spicy Miso are balanced and not overly heavy like some other Boston Ramen spots, and their Soy and Jigoku (my personal favorite) keep me coming back every time.  Show me another place that can deliver the same quality (and quantity) for under ten bucks and I'll be very surprised. Their side dishes are all winners. Try a different one every time - you won't be disappointed. I lived 5 minutes from the Allston location, but I will gladly commute to the new Medford location for this stuff. So glad they're back!!  Side note: Kaidama (second helping of noodles) is a thing here, which only some spots in Japan and very few in America do. Just sayin'

Name: Allston Ten Second Noodles 十秒到云南米线; Review: Loved the noodles and the broth. It will be my go to place for ramen (although it is not ramen)

Name: Ginger Exchange - Mission Hill Roxbury; Review: I ordered the Mama's Dumplings (port) and the Udon Noodle Soup. Dumplings had just enough crispinesss to the dough, without being hard and the filling was very flavorful. Udon was delivered with the fresh ingredients, tempura and broth all in separate containers to keep things fresh/not soggy. The broth serving is generous: Enough to fill the bowl with a little left over for when you've eaten some and the bowl could use a top-up. Flavor was on point for all the ingredients, and the broth was well-balanced (you can actually taste the other ingredients, not just soy). If you order for delivery, there's a fee, but also a tracker to give you a heads-up of when your food will arrive and where it's at in the process. I was shocked when they matched their estimated arrival to the second. Contactless delivery, and the driver actually sent a photo showing exactly where it was left. Worth it. Definitely dining here again

Name: Pikaichi; Review: Wow! What a nice surprise to have a Ramen shop just down the street from my work place! And even more, it's Pikaichi!!! I have visited it's previous Allston Super 88 location before a few times, and was sad that it had closed. I was also sad that my favorite Burrito place that used to be here closed recently, wondering what would come here next. Then one day, I noticed the familiar ""Lightning bolt"" Pikaichi sign in the window of this location. Really?! And finally this week, it has opened, and the wait is over! Hurray! Came to check things out on lunch today. Nice & clean, obviously brand new interior, of a familiar location to me. Seats were mostly full, but the wait time should be short. Ordered Pikaichi Miso Ramen. The Ramen noodles were my favorite thick 'Futo-men', and nicely cooked chewy. Miso base soup/broth was VERY tasty as well. A few slices of very tender and also tasty Chashu pork, and corn on the top. You can also add many different topping as well, if you like. I need to come here again to try out all the other flavors. Congratulations on re-opening here in West Medford! I will definitely be back for more"
Where can I find the best Thai curry,"Name: House of Siam; Review: Well it's a nice place as long as you don't order any Thai food. Ambience was nice, food not nice at all. We ordered yellow curry and drunk noodles. My curry was completely cold/ room temperature and had to be sent back. It was yellow colored water with excessive vegetables in it. It did not taste like yellow curry at all!!! We ordered both dishes mild and drunken noodles were at least level 4 hot. To add more to the bad experience waitress was not really bothered about the whole thing. The restaurant was not busy, only 2 tables. Anything but the Thai experience
Name: Wonder Spice Cafe; Review: We went one night, and loved it so much we came back again the next night. We both got the Southern Pad Thai the first night. It was pad thai made with curry spices, and it was amazing. The second night I got the normal pad thai, it was a bit under flavored, at least in comparison to the southern pad thai, but still good
Name: Riceberry; Review: Yeah a new Thai restaurant that is delicious and friendly.  Had fried dumplings, wild boar basil and Panang curry and all were very good.  The curry was spicy but not over the top.  Wine selection was decent too.  Seating is limited but comfy and cozy
Name: Pad Thai Cafe; Review: Not the best. Ordered seafood panang curry and received a huge plate of rice with a few pieces of seafood and veggies. I requested more curry sauce as I didn’t expect them to mix the curry and rice. I’m on the keto diet and a plate of rice was not acceptable. I was charged an addition $4 for curry sauce and told to order the dinner portion. Despite charging me dinner prices, I never received the dinner portion. Also, you have to clean your own plate so don’t add a tip. I ended up ruining my dress because I’m not used to cleaning my own plate at a restaurant. It was too late for me, I had already added the tip at check out. If you can find another Thai restaurant, I recommend trying there
Name: Chilli Duck; Review: I love Thai food and usually find Pad Thai to be good but boring. However, I went to Chili Duck and the first time I ordered Drunken Noodles which were good but my friend had the Pad Thai and it was out of this world good. Now every time I go I get the pad thai, chicken satay, and extra peanut sauce (which is also better than almost anywhere else I've been). The place is decent sized, I've never had to wait and they are good about call in take out orders. It's definitely my new favorite Thai plac","Name: Thai Dish; Review: Love it. Small mom and pop thai place with great prices and for my money, best thai food in the area. Brown Sugar right around the corner is not only worse tasting, but more expensive.  The more I eat here, the more I am pleased. Excellent curries, soups (love it with a little sour and spice), duck fried rice and drunken noodle. Plus the mango sticky rice dessert was outstanding.  Service in the summer here has been excellent, I'm a man in need of many water refills and they provide. The best part is definitely the taste of the food
Name: Thai Place; Review: My favorite spot for truly authentic Thai food. They even have Thai menu! If you're Asian or just really well informed of what northern Thai food is all about, and also if you have a strong passion for street-style papaya salad, this is the place to go! Never gonna be disappointed They offer up to 6 different papaya salad styles; Thai, Laotian, etc. The spicy soups are to die for! Variety of Yum dishes. And the service is super good!  Down falls would be that they don't have good, or any Thai dessert. (Except sticky rice mango, which was very bland) Don't get the ice cream here

Name: Kala Thai Cookery; Review: All it took was one order from this place and I’m hooked! I get the massaman curry and a Thai iced tea every time I go, and every single time, I’ve cleared the container (which I never do)! They’re a decent train ride away from my apartment but they’re absolutely worth the trip. I always carry out since being around people I don’t know who are maskless (patrons eating, never the staff), and they’re always speedy! Also one time someone complemented my pants and I had gone in since I had been having a rough time and wanted to get Thai food to cheer myself up and that seriously made my day. So kind, delicious food, great service, nothing but good things to say
Name: Bangkok City Restaurant; Review: Awesome!  Some of the best Thai food I have ever had.  My husband and I both got Tom Yom soup and I got mine with veggies and it was just full of a huge variety of veggies that I can tell were added fresh.  Both of our dishes were great, flavorful and fresh.  Our server was pleasant, attentive and had great timing.  Our host seated us far away from other diners (which seems like a dumb detail but SO MANY other places will walk you through an empty restaurant RIGHT to the table next to someone else). The only con was my husband said to make his VERY spicy and it just wasn't spicy at all for him.  I can understand if a restaurant feels they need to be safe here, but he was asking for it.

Name: Siam Bistro; Review: One of the best places to eat in Boston's Waterfront this is a No Frills authentic style Thai restaurant with great flavors and great spices to go along with those great flavors the fish sauce the curries and the noodles that great dishes to have. The Tamarind duck is a favorite along with the crispy chicken Thai basil the curries are not bad as well having flavor spice and aromantic smells and taste. The Drunken Noodles are not bad but not their best dish but good. I highly recommend trying this Bistr

Name: Riceberry; Review: We are here tonight for the first time with those both novice and experienced with Thai food. Everyone left delighted with our choices. The food was fresh and delicious. We had apps, soups, entrees, curries, and the pad Thai. We wanted to order it all again it was so good but we also wanted to order everything else on the menu to try it. The location is small so takeout may be the best bet...you won’t be sorry

Name: Riceberry; Review: Yeah a new Thai restaurant that is delicious and friendly.  Had fried dumplings, wild boar basil and Panang curry and all were very good.  The curry was spicy but not over the top.  Wine selection was decent too.  Seating is limited but comfy and cozy

Name: Thai Place; Review: Love this place. Good quality Thai food at very reasonable prices. It's not the most authentic Thai I've had, but the flavours are wonderful, the ""spicy"" sauces are actually spicy, and everything comes out piping hot and in generous portions. My favourite dishes are the spicy noodles and the appetizers (beef satay, mussels, butterfly shrimp, crab rangoons). The servers are efficient and friendly but don't push things (like specials) on you, unlike at a lot of American restaurants. The drinks are very affordable as well and they have a great casual bar area. My husband and I have been going to the Racha Thai restaurants for years and this is by far our favourite one"
Best dim sum places,"Name: Chau Chow City; Review: Food: dim sum was very good. We ordered some dim sum and they cooked for us, just with some wait. Prices are very reasonable.  The restaurant looks old, like the typical Chinatown type. This may turn off some people. Some may not care.  The wait staff were nice. I figure it was not very busy and they could be more attentative.  Overall, it serves real Chinese dim sum. And it is an old Chinatown restaurant
Name: China Pearl Restaurant; Review: *This review only pertains to my experiences with their Dim Sum menu*  While not my preferred place to go for Dim Sum, this place is growing on me. Their pork buns are delicious and are, perhaps, the perfect size. Not too big but not to small either. The rice dish that is tucked within a lotus leaf is also quite good, though China Pearl's features some king of meat within it, something I found odd since I always thought this was a vegetarian dish. A friend who has grown up on Dim Sum and acted as my group's culinary navigator confirmed that it doesn't usually have meat inside but can on occasion. Other things that my group of six ordered: shrimp dumplings, those long, flat noodles, sticky rice, pork dumplings (you can tell I'm a Dim sum expert), and those delicious sesame balls for dessert. They do have a buffet bar with other things but I've never ventured over there so I cannot stay what they have/don't have.  I will say that this place can be super crowded, especially if you are thinking about visiting on the weekend. Plan ahead; you might have to wait up to a half hour to be seated, though those tables do turner over fast. Also, waiters can be hit or miss. Same for the carts. You could be waiting fifteen minutes for the right cart to come by only to have it run out of food (again) before it reaches your table.  Despite the cons, this place is great, especially if you are new to Dim Sum or introducing it to your friends. One final thing: don't come here if you are a vegetarian. One of my friends is and she could only eat maybe two dishes, both of which our Dim Sum navigator had to find for her. If you love meat though, come on by
Name: Hei La Moon Restaurant; Review: My review and overall score for Hei La Moon is based on the last two occasions that I was here.  My first visit was because of a Traditional Chinese Wedding Banquet and my second being a Dim Sum visit.  I came here for a Chinese Dinner Wedding Banquet, with about one-hundred guests in attendance.  The blessed event served 10 both very beautifully and delicious dishes, each one having an amazing presentation and it’s on unique flavor to in honor to this celebration.   I have been to many of these banquets, especially recently with all my friends getting married, and they are all good, however, something you notice when attending banquets with a large amount of guests is that by the time one of the dishes come out, it is cooled because it takes so long for the back of the kitchen to plate all the dishes for all the tables.  However, this was not the case for this banquet.  Hei La Moon executed this very well, where the dishes came out very timely to all the tables, making it so the dishes were hot.  Because of the great experience that I had with the banquet, I came back here for Dim Sum with visiting friends from out of town.  This too was done very well.  We came on Saturday, and had to wait 30 minutes for a seat.  FYI for those who are not familiar with Chinese Dim Sum and weekends in China Town, it’s very busy, so expect to wait a bit and also be prepared to share a table with complete strangers.  However, the wait and sharing the table with another group of customers is so worth the food and the experience of having Dim Sum.  It was actually because we were sharing the table with a group of strangers, that my friends from out of town saw some things that they were interested trying and ended up liking very much.  The Dim Sum dishes here are very good, there are a lot of options and the carts being pushed by the staff are moving around very quickly, making it so you can get your items quickly.  If there is something you want and had not seen yet, you can flag down one of the staff with the vest, and let them know what it is you are looking for, and they will bring it to your table.  I have yet come here for dinner, but if the Dim Sum and Chinese Banquet is any indication of their work, I can only imagine that it is just as good
Name: Great Taste Bakery & Restaurant; Review: Service: Do not come here if you are a local. They will not prioritize your order or give you more tea. We had to wait 20-25 minutes for each dish to come out. Traditional dim sum typically have all of the food ready as soon as you order. This dim sum restaurant is a typical ""order and wait for your food to come"". However, the food came out 2 at a time. The staff were arguing with each other constantly. The way they line up their guests, its breaking COVID standards. Though you sit ""6 feet apart"", customers who are walking in will stand next to you. What was ironic was how we even saw customers come after us and RECEIVE THEIR FOOD FASTER than we did. We felt extremely ignored. I support local businesses, but that does not mean that I should accept this quality of service.  Food: Food was mediocre. Does not draw a comparison to good dim sum places that I've been to previously. The tea was great. I felt that because the service was extremely bad, it ruined the food quality with how slow food was coming out and how we did not get a refill of tea.  TLDR: I looked forward to coming here when I was planning to visit Boston for so long. Finally coming here was not up to my expectations. Service standards are a joke
Name: China Pearl Restaurant; Review: DONT EVER COME! 1. Extremely long waiting time. People waits 30 mins to check the bill. Foods take 1 hours and they even didn’t figure out what was served and what wasn’t.  2. Staff are not organized and with no experience. Tables are left for a long time until someone comes to clean it. And the staff needs to come twice to clean the table next to it. Nobody is welcoming when there are at least 3 tables emptied and sanitized.  3. Finally, foods are not authentic. I came from Guangdong(where dim sum was found). I can tell the food here only reaches a passing score. Do you want to hire a student with 2.0GPA? Want some American-DIM SUM, go for it","Name: Winsor Dim Sum Café; Review: My boyfriend and I were passing through Chinatown one late Sunday morning. We were actually on our way to a breakfast sammie spot, but then decided last minute to have dim sum instead, since we were in the area anyway. A quick Yelp search showed me Winsor Dim Sum Cafe and it was only a block away from where we were at, so that's how we decided on that place.  As soon as we arrived, I realized that I had been to this spot 5 years earlier and remember thinking it was only okay. 5 years later, my opinion has not changed. Maybe I'm just used to NYC dim sum, but whenever I have dim sum outside of NYC, it just doesn't taste quite as good. Winsor will do it if you're in a bind and can't find any other dim sum place, but I'm sure Boston has got to have at least one better one out there.  One thing I couldn't decide if I liked or not was their paper system of ordering, as opposed to them pushing the carts around. On one hand, the paper is very efficient - you just mark down the quantities of all of the items that you want. On the other hand, you won't know what the dim sum looks like until it actually comes out.  So now, I'm writing this review so that if I go back to Boston in another 5 years, I'll know to look for a different dim sum joint
Name: China Pearl Restaurant; Review: Best dim sum in Boston! We got a table for two with no wait at 10:30am on a Sunday! We usually go earlier in order to miss the crowds, but we got lucky. We're regulars, but our visit last weekend was worthy of a review. A fine selection with the friendly service I've had there to date! Buns, dumplings, rices, delicious fried things...it was all so good. A new feature since our last visit: pour guards on the teapots. It's SO much safer. Before, even an experienced tea drinker/dim sum goer could expect to spill a few cups on the table, but no more! We didn't spill a drop and it was super easy to refill our cups throughout the meal. As always, the atmosphere and decor are fine--nothing overly special, but not shabby. We also took quite a bit home with us for lunch and the rest of the family. We usually eat ourselves silly and spend about $60 for four people and we kept that rate this weekend
Name: China Pearl Restaurant; Review: *This review only pertains to my experiences with their Dim Sum menu*  While not my preferred place to go for Dim Sum, this place is growing on me. Their pork buns are delicious and are, perhaps, the perfect size. Not too big but not to small either. The rice dish that is tucked within a lotus leaf is also quite good, though China Pearl's features some king of meat within it, something I found odd since I always thought this was a vegetarian dish. A friend who has grown up on Dim Sum and acted as my group's culinary navigator confirmed that it doesn't usually have meat inside but can on occasion. Other things that my group of six ordered: shrimp dumplings, those long, flat noodles, sticky rice, pork dumplings (you can tell I'm a Dim sum expert), and those delicious sesame balls for dessert. They do have a buffet bar with other things but I've never ventured over there so I cannot stay what they have/don't have.  I will say that this place can be super crowded, especially if you are thinking about visiting on the weekend. Plan ahead; you might have to wait up to a half hour to be seated, though those tables do turner over fast. Also, waiters can be hit or miss. Same for the carts. You could be waiting fifteen minutes for the right cart to come by only to have it run out of food (again) before it reaches your table.  Despite the cons, this place is great, especially if you are new to Dim Sum or introducing it to your friends. One final thing: don't come here if you are a vegetarian. One of my friends is and she could only eat maybe two dishes, both of which our Dim Sum navigator had to find for her. If you love meat though, come on by
Name: Chau Chow City; Review: I don't know about Dim Sums but I do know that the best Spicy Shrimp in Boston (and Toronto) is there!!!! 🤗🤗 My 1-2-3: 1)  Try their alcoholic drink that is served in a low bowl (don't remember the name) - It is delicious! 2)  Try their Crab Ragun entree (OMG) 3)  Price is good  When I am in Boston, this is my mandatory stop
Name: Hei La Moon Restaurant; Review: The dim sum at Hei La Moon is consistently good, but there's very little that will blow you away.  I came with a large group, and so got to try a broad sampling of the dim sum menu: 蝦餃 (shrimp dumplings) with and without chives, 燒賣 (shumei), 腸粉 (flat noodles), 芋頭餃 (taro dumplings), 牛柏葉 (tripe), 排骨 (ribs) , 鳳爪 (chicken feet), 叉燒包 (BBQ buns). The dumplings and buns here are standard and well-executed: the wrappers are bouncy or fluffy, depending on the type, the fillings are flavorful, and there's a good proportion between the filling and wrapper. You won't find ""jumbo"" 燒賣 here that completely bungle the filling to wrapper ratio, but you also won't find anything as creative as what the best places in LA or SF have. The 芋頭餃 have a nice contrast between the shatteringly crisp batter and the rich creamy filling, but they do tend to be on the greasy side. Likewise, the offal is tasty and exactly what you'd expect. The baby did enjoy his first tripe though!  Be sure to save room for the sweets: the syrup for the 豆花 (silken tofu) is cloyingly sweet, but the 糯米糍 (mochi) and 西米露 (Sago) are excellent. There are three flavors of 糯米糍 here: the white ones are filled with crushed peanuts and sugar, the green ones with something that tastes like banana paste, and the orange ones with fresh mango. The 西米露 came out of a watermelon and had watermelon chunks in it, and was delightfully light and refreshing","Name: Winsor Dim Sum Café; Review: My boyfriend and I were passing through Chinatown one late Sunday morning.

Very authentic, well cooked dim sum. From the chicken feet, to the egg yolk bao bun, to the shumais. Basically everything you get will be delicious. We ordered so much and everything was priced so cheap. I think amongst for people with leftovers we only paid 20 per person with tip with tip.  The soup dumplings were probably my least favorite, I've had some really great ones before and this place did not give you enough. The exterior was a little thick and there was not much soup to begin.  The tripe was delicious it had a nice barbecue taste.  the shumai was perfectly done, so soft and there was so much shrimp.  The ribs were very tender  The turnip bites with bean sprouts or a bit on the oily side, but they were very addicting.  Deep fried dumpling with minced pork inside was probably my favorite. The texture is just so odd that I enjoyed it so much.  The fried shrimp was good, but not as juicy as I'd like.  The shrimp dumplings were done well too. Great amount of shrimp and perfect with the spicy soy dipping sauce.  I love the chicken feet, a nice subtle flavor of sweet Asian BBQ. The feet fell off the bone so easily.  The egg yolk what's the star of the show. This is definitely a dessert. Keep in mind that you should keep your face away when popping open these babies. They squirt right up!  the brightside about this place is that they serve hot tea with your meal. Great for digesting and it gives you enough space for more! The service is not up to par, but that's what you would get in Chinatown. You need to request more napkins and keep in mind their chili oil is extremely spicy. In Texas, artist don't come like that! If you're looking for a great price for authentic dim sum, come here!

Name: Gourmet Dumpling House; Review: This place was on our list for a long long time. Now that we have been here, it's off our list - for good. Here is a long and short of it:  - Dumpling options: really disappointing. We always thought the juicy dumplings were a specialty and there would be lots of other options for dim sum. Not the case. And the juicy dumplings themselves - a major let down. Dry from the outside. The juice inside is just vinegar. And the accompanying dip is even more tart and vinegary than the juice inside.  - The rest of the menu is very extensive. So just don't get the hype about dumplings at all (and hence the name of the place is absolutely deceiving)  - We got what seemed to be a good entree, to understand what the huge menu had to offer. The Schezuan seafood dish. Supposed to be a spicy, hot dish. Again - very disappointed. Lack of classic schezuan flavors. No heat of any kind. And where were those red schezuan peppercorns?? We weren't even compelled to ask for the hot chili oil to make the taste better. A half hearted dish just put together - without any personality or flavors.  - And expect to get your check halfway through your meal. So if you decide to try something more, tough luck.  - finally, the space inside is absolutely tiny. Anyone who has been to Taiwan Cafe (mind-blowing food btw) has more space inside than this one.  So the math was pretty straight forward. Tiny space. A lot of hype. After 5:30pm on weekends - hence = long waits on the Main Street. Result - even more hype!!!!!  To those who go here again and again and again and again - good for you all! Please keep doing that. Leave the other places for us. Thank you very much. Which places are better than this one? You think I'm gonna disclose? Nope. Please keep standing in the wait. ""This place is really good"".  PS: Gave 2 and not 1 star because - this place definitely has the potential, to be downgraded from 2 to 1 - if and whenever we do decide to go back

Name: The Q; Review: This place is way over-priced. We ordered the $12 tuna takati and it came with just 6 pieces very very thinly cut tuna slices. Not worth $12 at all.  Then we ordered 2 hot pot combos, one supreme seafood and one high choice lamb. The supreme seafood is a joke, not even enough for one person. So we had to order two more high choice lamb. The broth is ok, but when the water evaporated, the waiter did not bother to add more water or broth. So the broth got very salty later on.  So still not enough food, we ordered Shanghai chowmein with pork. I figure this place cares about customers' health so much that I could only find several thinly shredded pork pieces in the noodle.  The last thing, when we received the bill, they added 18% tip to the check. They said they automatically add that to any check with a party with 5 or more people. They claim the tip is for the waiting staff and there is nothing they can do about it.  This place is such a disappointment. Everything is so much over-priced. And adding 18% tip to a family of 5 (3 kids) is really bad. So we still had to pay 18% tip with bad over-priced food?  I do not recommend this place to our friends

Name: Great Barbecue; Review: Great takeout. $12 for half a chicken and $1 for rice. Delicious, simple, and fast. Excellent place to grab a quick bite and super friendly staff. Hidden gem in Chinatown

Name: Pho Hoa; Review: Been here several times before. My go to Pho place in Boston. I used to think this was the best Pho place in Chinatown. However, this last time, the Pho was not as flavorful and they were more skimpy on the meat. Perhaps the place changed hands or cooks or maybe just an off day. But reason enough to try one of the other places next time"
Italian pasta options nearby,"Name: Monica's Mercato; Review: Complete frauds... While the products are of good quality and authentic, the store presents itself as a real Italian shop. Meanwhile, not one person in that shop could even count to ten in Italian. My wife is from Italy and went to the deli to ask if they had a specific Italian meat. They guy behind the counter didn't even know what she said and couldn't even pronounce it. Of course he ended up saying no with a confused face. There was an old woman in there the last time I went who only spoke Italian. You would think that ""Monica's Mercato"" would surely have at least one person to come and speak to her and help her, but no. Everyone looked at her confused and I had to interpret for her. While I understand that nowadays it would be difficult to find a staff full of Italian speakers, if you're going to represent yourself as some authentic Italian shop in the heart of an Italian neighborhood, there should be something Italian about your shop aside from ""Prodotto di Italia"" written on the label. Just another fraudulent,  fake Italian spot
Name: Mario's Restaurant; Review: Mario's looks like the quintessential local Italian restaurant-- exposed brick walls, checkered table cloths, and a menu full of Italian comfort food.  After eating here twice, I find that it is really a disappointment. The food is suprisingly pricy considering the neighborhood and the interior of the restaurant. $17 for a pasta dish, anything with meat runs around $20, and seafood can top out next to $30. I don't mind paying that kind of money for good Italian food having grown up in Providence, but the food wasn't that much to write home about.  The pasta was overcooked, the razor-thin pounded veal lacked flavor and was soggy. The lobster in the pasta special was a bit rubbery. I know others have had a great experience at this restaurant, but for a local, casual Italian restaurant, the food isn't nearly good enough to justify prices that belong more in the North End than Eastie
Name: Coolidge Market; Review: Was skeptical about the outside of the place but a friend told me that the Italian sub is the best. For $4.50 you can get the best Italian sub in the city. It was absolutely delicious, and made with love by a little old woman. 100000% recommend. Although I am sad that no other Italian sandwich will compare
Name: Osteria Peppino Pizzeria; Review: This place awesome !! I've been in Georgetown for over a year now. There's no authentic italian pizza in this town.  One night i google authentic italian pizza near me and this place pops up. My girl sue and i jump in my jeep drive about 15 minutes into topsfeild and drop in for a visit !! Much to my surprise i know this family from their previous restaurant that i had visited on a weekly basis. Peppi his sons and daughter are extremely nice and put out an outstanding product from the Italian plate to the pork chops it's great!! the pizza is as italian as it gets !! And the chicken parm over pasta is must try. You'll not be disappointed !! Try it you'll love it !!!!
Name: Lo Conte's; Review: Nice restaurant for Italian food. Ordered the seafood special, very fresh and tasty. The pasta is soft and the sauce is very good. $18 for a pasta, $25 for a plate (meat + pasta) and $10 for a glass of wine. I guess the price is standard in North End. Service is good, we asked for olive oil for the bread with no problem. Spit the check is allowed, 20% tips were included in the bill. This was the only place we found that the line was less than 45 mins on a Saturday night. Other places went too far. The missing star: they gave us the bill immediately when they saw we finished the main plate. They didn't ask us if we would like to see the dessert menu. Maybe because we sit for too long or ate too slowly. We were too full to have dessert anyway","Name: Pasta E Pomodoro; Review: Tip: A stellar Italian choice in Boston and a great value to boot.  The veal scappolini and seafood pasta are among the best I've had and the tiramisu is decadent
Name: Vapiano; Review: This is a great option for a group. I brought 35 people here and there was definitely something for everyone and in the budget. It is cafeteria style and each guest gets a card which they ordered and I collected afterwards and paid for all of them. Most pastas & pizzas are about $12. I had the carbonara and loved it because it was from the pan to my plate and I carried it over to a table myself. I had strawberry basil sangria that was terrific as well. I like that it feels nicer but the prices are really low
Name: Linguine's Italian Eatery; Review: My go-to lunch spot in Marlboro. They have great pasta dishes, subs (love the chicken parmesan!), pizza, and traditional Italian chicken/veal dishes. I usual get a salad that can be topped with grilled chicken, but they will slice a breaded chicken breast instead upon request. The homemade house thick creamy Italian dressing is the best I've found anywhere, and they serve everything with warm pizza dough rolls. Even watching carbs, I can't help but dip a roll in the dressing.  My other favorite lunch is in the winter, they often have either chicken escarole or escarole bean soup (larger bowl). Both are packed with chicken/veggies/beans.  During the day, you order at the counter, and seat yourself. I believe they have wait service at night. I look forward to the days I work in Marlboro just for the Linguine's lunch
Name: Pasta Beach Boston; Review: Life's a lukewarm beach at this wharfside spot.  The 9 of us shared a bunch of stuff. 3 salads, 2 pastas, 3 pizzas. The portions are large and I definitely recommend splitting. We were hungry during this lunch outing, so the table bread with dipping oil was a nice immediate remedy, and our salads came out  rapidly, although they did not offer much excitement or variety The napoleatana with (very little) eggplant, tomato, and mozzarella was too similar to the caprese, and overall there were too many undressed greens under the toppings compared to the good stuff.  Next up came the pastas and pizzas. In terms of the pasta dishes, we ordered the frutti de mari and the volare which both had shellfish, which can be a bit messy to eat when trying to remove many tiny clams from their shells (thanks goodness for the wetnaps thrown on the table). Both the red and white whine sauces were good, but the pasta itself was a bit underdone and tough. I found myself still needing to add red pepper flakes and Parmesan to highlight the flavors.  The brick oven in the back promises crispy pies, but the prosciutto, margherita, and fungi pizzas we received were just alright. The thick tomato sauce made the thin crust soggy, so the topics just slid off, making utensils very necessary. The crust also didn't have much of a flavor, so I found that the toppings tasted pretty much the same without it underneath.  The best part of the meal was dessert. In true Italian fashion, we ordered comforting capuccinos, deliciously creamy tiramisus, and a lemony creme brulee. The service was spotty here, as some lattes were forgotten and delayed.  Overall, a decent, Italian midday meal for a group in a nice location. Just beachy

Name: D'Parma Italian Cuisine; Review: Love this place! The pasta is amazing, awesome apps and they are open til like 1am.. Tonight I got the D'Parma salad, chicken cutlet, roasted red peppers, fresh Mozzarella cheese, cucumbers, tomatoes, red onion and lettuce with amazing house dressing, it was so good.. We also got the shrimp, scallop, crab Ravioli app. It was very small but so good. I Love the amazing fresh baked bread that they serve with oil for dipping.. I load it up with cheese and crush red pepper, its so good. I also love the subs.. the Chicken Parm and Meatball parm are pretty amazing","Name: SRV; Review: I would say that I was really quite disappointed with SRV.  The review are great, the space looks nice, etc. We got the tasting menu, which I think is pretty good value.  The starters and the middle-course items were quite good. My favorite was the beef carpaccio, which I thought was beautiful with great quality ingredients and a unique flavor profile. It was creative. The pastas I thought were a big disappointment-- they didn't have any of that great chew that I associate with handmade pasta at high-end restaurants. They had the texture of like soba noodles or pasta noodles I'd make at home. The langostine pasta also could've used an even richer shellfish flavor. Sad that it was a bit better is all.  Note that the dining room gets crowded and totally booked quickly. However, there is actually a number of bar seating or unreserved seating, so don't be discouraged by no reservation availability if you are a small party

Name: Trattoria Il Panino; Review: I will start by saying that I am Italian, and I was raised eating both “red sauce” Italian and authentic Italian food.   I believe both have their place in our food culture, but  the problem with Trattoria il Panino is that they do not execute either one well.  I would consider them a “red sauce” Italian restaurant, with some slightly more authentic dishes on the menu. We started with the Caprese salad, and they pair a delicate beautiful imported buffalo mozzarella with a tomato that was not only flavorless, but also hard as a rock. It was very disappointing, and showed a lack of attention to the quality of their ingredients, which is something Italian chefs pride themselves on.  Along those lines, the table olive oil is very smooth, but also very flavorless.  The bread is standard and soft.  For my main course, I ordered my favorite pasta dish of all time, the spaghetti carbonara.  I have eaten carbonara all over the country and in Italy, and ordering it here was a mistake.  They add cream to their sauce, which automatically is not a true carbonara.  In the vein of “red sauce” Italian, maybe those not familiar with real carbonara may enjoy this, but even that is a stretch.  The pancetta was undercooked and not flavorful, and the pasta was overcooked.  Even eating it from the pan disappointed me.  It wasn’t MY pan with all the fond from frying the pancetta - it was an unused clean pan and simply plated this way as a gimmick.  My friend ordered the arrabiata.  I had one bite of that.  It was standard fare and there was nothing wrong with it, but it was not something I would ever seek out.  I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone

Name: Cafe Artigiano; Review: This restaurant serves excellent food. We were hesitant at first cause the place does not look that busy but we were so glad we went in and ordered lunch. I had the meatball pasta with fusilli and my friend had the veal parm with linguini.Everything tasted delicious. Give this place a try, you’ll be glad you did. Definitely more people should know where to have a great plate of pasta. We were recommended the stuffed eggplant from the cashier, will try it next week for sure. Very friendly and attentive staff

Name: Pavia Catering; Review: Everything is good but this place is tucked away and only local workers know about it. They have a bunch of deals with sodas that are great and more sandwiches, pizza, and pasta selections then you'd expect. Their wraps are kind of like burritos because of the rice (but you can get brown rice, yay!). The calzone definitely serves 2 so get the sauce on the side as you will have leftovers! I like how many meatless options they have and how cheap a side of pasta is

Name: Cafe Artigiano; Review: Cafe Artigiano, is a few steps away from my school. Everytime I go and get lunch, or am in Boston I always go there for lunch and breakfast. The staff there is amazing and very friendly. I love the pastas, chicken parm with the homeade fusilli is my go to. I have tried almost everything and have never been disappointed. The nutella stuffed french toast is to die for and the homefries are absolutely amazing. I love it there!!! I definitely recommend this place to everyone"

I found this restaurant on brighton ave and just  came to try it once. It was on friday evening crowded with many people. I had recieved a great welcome from this guys. I ordered  palak paneer with some garlic bread and it was served with great taste. Mango lassi was really awesome. These guys also do home delivery and they are very sure about 40 min delivery time. It was like another good news for me, where i can get food from the best restaurant within 40 minutes. I would like to rate this restaurant as top indian retaurant where i could not found this taste in the other retaurants which i visited near this area. My friends from different countries like indian food and they all keep asking me the best indian restaurant, so now i can proudly suggest this restaurant for best indian tasty food. Thanks for the management and staff for serving the best indian food
Name: Halal Indian Cuisine; Review: Where do I begin with this place. From the horrible quality food to the unfriendly staff who overcharged me on two separate occasions for a side item that was supposed to be included in the meal per the menu. Calling the food comparable to frozen Indian food would be disrespectful frozen Indian food from the grocery store. This is the worst tasting Indian food I have ever tried. If your that desperate for Indian food and live in the Brigham Circle area there are plenty of Indian restaurants with take out that deliver to this area with higher quality food FYI
Name: D'Guru; Review: I must say this is some pretty good Indian food! (Sure there is some better Indian restaurants in the city) but they've managed to incorporate authentic Indian cuisine with authentic spices to the point were an average American could eat the entrees. The flavors nice the meat and vegetarian entrees are good. And the price to portion ratio is on point This is a great place for take out and for lunch I recommend if you like Indian cuisin
Name: Tandoori Grill; Review: The food was AMAZING and the service was great! Definitely one of the best Indian buffets outside of Boston. The food was cooked perfectly, the bread was extremely fresh, and the owner offered whatever specialty I was craving made to order. I would recommend this to anyone who likes REAL AUTHENTIC HIGH QUALITY INDIAN FOOD. I have eaten at every Indian restaurant in the area and this is by far my favorite. 5 stars!!
Name: Chutneys Boston; Review: Their Indian Food is definitely homemade and delicious; some of the best I've ever had !  It's not a fancy place as the space also contains a Subway Sandwich Shop for those not partial to Indian Food. I don't normally like Indian Food, but I was blown away by the Chicken Curry over Biryani Rice and will definitely go back to try other offerings. They also had Lychee Juice by the bottle and the ingredient list showed lychee puree as the second ingredient, so even though not made there, a high quality product","Name: Curry House; Review: Crispy Aloo Tikki dipped in fresh Mint Chutney; it’s the best way to beat mood blues or just shed away work stress at one of the fine corners of the Curry House.  I love coming here and savoring delicacies that I used to enjoy at my home in India
Name: Curry House; Review: I really wanted to like this place as it is the closest Indian restaurant to my office, but the chicken korma (my usual calibration dish) was uninspiring and a little watery while the chicken tikka masala wasn't much better with dull and washed out flavors.  Perhaps I just was there on a bad day, but I'll be venturing further afield in search of a better Indian spot for lunch
Name: D'tandoor; Review: Had butter chicken. Still can't find one like my dads. They use a lot of tomato sauce rather using heavy cream or sour cream. Very little butter used. First thing is color, butter chicken is light orange. This was dark red and I got medium spice. The biriyani also had too much anise star seasoning. I had one bite and that's all I could taste. I also asked for boneless and they gave me with bone and not much meat. Indian people: just ask your parents or grandparents to make you food. I've been to over 30 Indian restaurants in Mass and they all don't have good curry. Like its not that hard. White people won't complain because they don't know much in the same way Indians don't know if Italian food is good outside. Save your money, eat at home or your aunties
Name: Halal Indian Cuisine; Review: Just walked out with the most horrible experience. Waited 25 minutes for an order of a chicken Tikka curry and a couple of naans. Reminded the person at the counter  person..he asks me to wait a couple of minutes. About 7-8 minutes later I realize he has kept a bag of  food at  the counter. So I go up to him and ask is that mine and he is like yes. Does not bother to tell me it's my order..nothing. I ask him why he didn't bother to tell me and he is like sorry I was busy. Quite a horrible experience.Saw him go and serve takeaway to atleast a couple of customers before that (incidentally, all of them were White of course). Enough Indian food places in the vicinity to avoid a horrible experience like this. Don't waste your time
Name: Punjab Palace; Review: Pretty terrible first experience with Punjab Palace. I Ordered delivery, which I guess always comes with some risk. I ordered through Grubhub and was informed that the delivery would be late, then was notified it would be late again. When I was notified my order was picked up and on the way, it was delivered in a timely manner. When I opened my order, it had the correct appetizer, and an entree that was no where near what I ordered. I couldn't tell you what entree I received, but I'm fairly certain chicken curry isn't dark green. And the extra I paid for garlic naan was met with naan. So my entire experience was 1hr wait for food preparation, 10min delivery, and 1/3 of my order delivered. After 1 hour, I think it's fair to expect the order to be correct. Instead, I received a meal that they needed to send out. I would have given it a second star if it satisfied my crave for Indian cuisine","Name: Curry House; Review: I really wanted to like this place as it is the closest Indian restaurant to my office, but the chicken korma (my usual calibration dish) was uninspiring and a little watery while the chicken tikka masala wasn't much better with dull and washed out flavors.

Name: Boston Catering; Review: Most flavorful and complex curry I've tried in boston. Hands down. We had the Chicken Vindaloo and Palak Paneer. Portions were big, and included complimentary pompadom and chutneys.  The place is cozy and the staff was very friendly and attentive, plus they even served complimentary dessert","Name: Boston Pizza and Curry; Review: I just love Boston Pizza and Curry! Formerly Villa, the pizza quality is just as great when you're in the mood for a greek style, comforting pizza. I have also tried several of the homemade curry dishes that are very well made with a great balance of flavor (not too salty thank goodness). I believe the naan is homemade as well! My favorite was the chicken tikka masala with white basmati rice. Very friendly staff and all around great food

Name: Kala Thai Cookery; Review: Kala has been my go-to Thai place since my friends recommended it to me. I've desperately missed decent Thai food and this really hits the spot! Honestly, every dish I've had here is just amazing - curries, fried rice, pad thai (I don't even like pad thai), soup, see ew, char kway teow. Oh man, all of it is super mouth watering! I typically order for pickup or delivery, but definitely could eat there as well. It's a small location but it's cute and everyone is very friendly. Please, do yourself a favor and get food from here

Name: Boston Pizza and Curry; Review: Went to Boston Pizza and Curry while in the area because we had a coupon and wanted to try something different . We ordered the Garlic Naan and Basmati rice to which they gave is a complementary side of  Chicken Tiki Masala. The food was excellent and the staff were even better. Friendly and helpful. The Naan was soft and flavorful and the chicken and sauce was perfectly seasoned and not over spiced. We also ordered  the Villa Special pizza than was more than delicious and loaded with fresh toppings. I would definitely be sure to stop in any time your looking for fresh delicious Curries and Pizza. If your not sure what to order just ask they are very happy to explain everything and help you find a dish you are sure to love

Name: IndianStyle; Review: One of the worst Indian restaurants around. I suggest going to Woburn if you want authentic Indian food. My friends described IndianStyle food as ""home cooked food"", but honestly, it's worse; I don't know how it has almost 5 stars rating.. Waste of money.  Edit: I got roti and dal makhani. Roti was below average. It could be because it was a takeout or possibly the ingredients aren't good quality. As for Dal Makhani, it was watery and loaded with chili pepper. I don't mind spicy food, but it is supposed to be in balanced with other spices. In this sabzi, I couldn't taste any salt, garlic, tomatoes, ghee, butter and other ingredients. I was surprisingly disappointed considering this is a famous Panjabi dish. I honestly had to spit out the food. It was that bad. I didn't even bother tasting Veg. Chicken Korma after eating Dal Makhani. I usually don't write reviews unless a restaurant is really good or really bad. Knowing this is a small family owned restaurant, I feel bad putting this review"
Mexican taco spots,"Name: Pueblo Viejo; Review: El Pueblo Viejo makes the most delicious pupusas I’ve tasted so far here in Massachusetts. This is my family’s first option for pupusas. But I’ve also tried some of their Mexican dishes, I’d say their Mexican dishes are not typical Mexican food it’s more like Taco Bell. However, this is a great restaurant to take your family. Great service, the ladies are always polite and attentive. I wish I could give 5 stars but you guys need to improve on your Mexican dishes. I do recommend this restaurant
Name: Tavitas Mexican; Review: I visited for ""Taco Tuesday,"" which is advertised as an all-you-can-eat taco night. The choices are very limited, though - you have to pick either chicken or carnitas, and can't switch to the other type of taco at any point during your meal. The tacos come with fermented vegetables (onion, cabbage, carrot) on them, which is fine if you're ordering a sandwich from Bon Me, but which is not so good when trying to enjoy a Mexican meal.  In addition, a small serving chips and salsa costs $5, plus $2 more any time you want more chips.  I wouldn't eat here again
Name: Picante Taqueria; Review: This one of two Mexican spots in Medford that has very good food. The tacos both chicken and steak were real good, the chicken was probably a little better but still tasteful. The chicken & steak bowl I got also was phenomenal, The rice and beans were great had very good flavors unlike some places that have salty beans and rice, this place had done it just right. The smoothies were surprisingly really good, the papaya smoothie was really pleasant not really sweet and the piña colada was a little bit sweeter but it tastes just as good. The restaurant was nice and spacious felt cozy as well. The service is excellent and friendly and quick. Would put this place in the top 2 Mexican spots in just Medford. Phenomenal 👌
Name: Tenoch Mexican; Review: Somewhat disappointing lunch experience. Having seen the strong reviews, I was optimistic and looking forward to some delicious Mexican food.  Chips/Guac/Salsa: 2/5 The chips were pretty bland with no salt on them. The guac was actually quite good, but could have used some additional seasoning. The salsa was the most disappointing part of the entire meal. It tasted like canned tomato sauce with a few pieces of fresh diced tomatoes and onion. Not great..  Burrito: 3/5 I did not have this meal, but my friend did. It was quite large, but was overwhelmingly rice, beans and cheese. Needed more veggies.  Tacos: 3/5 The fish taco was ok. I had taken it to go, so by the time I ate it, it was a bit soggy. There was a smoky sauce of some sort which kind of threw me off, as I was expecting more brighter/citrus flavors for a fish taco. Pastor taco was good. The chicken was a bit dry but complimented well with pineapple. The last taco I had was the Campechano. This was the best of the three. The chorizo and carnitas were juicy and flavorful!  Alas.
Name: Villa Mexico Cafe; Review: Let me just start by saying, I NEVER write reviews, but in this case I could not help myself. Also, tacos are my favorite food and I have tried them in many places throughout Boston and other cities.  That being said, this has to be the stingiest place in Boston. I ordered the tacos on taco Tuesday which gives 3 tacos for 10$. First, any taco over 3$/each better be a damn good and filling taco. These tacos were average in taste and wayyyy too small. When the cook handed my my tacos in the tinfoil, I actually thought there was only one taco inside because there was no way all three were going to fit. They all fit and that little tinfoil wrap because there is basically ZERO protein in the taco. They shred the beef, so in total I would guess I had no more than two ounces of beef combined in ALL THREE TACOS. That is absurd. For 10$ I expect to at least have had enough food to hold me over till after work. This was like a lunch appetizer. Do yourself a favor and go order a mini salad with steak at boloco, its a better price, better value, and still a decent taste. And If you want to see how real tacos should be made, go to Cactus Mexican Grill in Maverick Square, East Boston","Name: Taco Mex Restaurant; Review: I love coming here, i live in peabody and make it a point to drive here at least 4 times a month, they have best tacos, shrimp ceviche and a huge menu that i havent been able to get thru but i will. Parking is fairly easy and when you walk in you feel like your in a cantina. plates and servings are huge and prices are great. the service is great, my favorite waitress is cristina b. she is friendly and always is checking up to make sure i have my drinks or if i need anything.  if you want good mexican, latin food this place is it, i wish they would deliver to peabody but obivously that doesnt happen!!!!
Name: Taco Mania; Review: Go here for the traditional TORTAS. Absolutely melt in ur mouth good. These r spanish sadwitches filled w shredded chicken/steak, shreded lettuce, tomatoes,& avacados in a traditional spanish sub roll (super soft) thats lightly  toasted w butter. Addictive. Its also very low cost =) . And their Liquados (milkshakes ) are phenomenal, cant chose  wrong, all outstanding and fresh. They also have a buffet which looks kinda mediocre.... and their pupusas are bland. I'd give them 5 stars on just the torta but i have to mention the other items to be fair. Highly  recommended
Name: Dorado Tacos Boston; Review: Dorados is a great place for quick street tacos, among other delicious tex-mex inspired foods. While they seem to have shrunk a bit since they first opened, the quality of the tacos has remained intact. My favorite is the Baha inspired fish tacos. They have a regular and spicy version, and each includes beer battered Pollack, plus salsa fresca, pickled veggies and crema. They have a great deal where you can order a meal including two tacos, rice, beans and a charred jalapeno. Another great unique item are their Cemetas - sandwiches with your choice of meat, chipotles in adobo sauce, avocado, Oaxaca cheese, black beans and cilantro.  If you are around on their weekend, they also have a nice little brunch. The place is small with limited seating outside, and on nice days, a few tables outside where you can people watch until your heart's content
Name: Loco Taqueria & Oyster Bar; Review: TACO TUESDAY @ LOCO: Their tacos that usually cost $5-6 a piece, they were cut down to $2-$3.50 a taco (think 50% off).  Keep in mind that other people are also aware of this amazing deal, so this place will be packed and noisy.  We ""vultured"" two spots at the bar after hearing there was a 45 minute wait, and even so there were plenty of people without seats at all, just standing around the bar with their cocktails.  Food highlights: *Grilled Street Corn* appetizer, *Baja Fried Fish Taco*, and the *Cola Pork Carnitas Taco.*  We also tried the Chicken Tinga, Grilled Avocado, and Fried Pork -- would not recommend these.  *Grilled Street Corn* is juicy, charred, and sweet, drizzled in a garlic and chili mojo sauce that vaguely reminded me of chipotle mayo but better.  SO GOOD.  So sad there were only three (aka I'm too broke to buy more of these.)  The *Fish Taco* and *Carnitas Taco* have an excellent ratio of textures and flavors: crunch and juicy; umami and tangy.  After being very underwhelmed by our first taco (aka the dried mess they call the Pork Taco), the fish taco stood as PERFECTION in contrast -- it's been a while since I've had such a delicate, yet satisfying crunch.  The carnitas taco was deeply satisfying in flavor; they drew out the umami of the meat and brightened it with sweetness (pineapple salsa), and crunch (mini tortilla chips).  IN SUM: I'm pretty satisfied!  Yes, they are busy, cramped, extremely noisy, and their service exists only in its bare bones (I've heard they're pretty packed on non-promo days too).  However, the hit menu items will have you CRAVING them for a long while.  Definitely give this place a try
Name: Taqueria El Barrio; Review: Consider me a taco connoisseur. I could live, breathe and die by tacos... if ""death by tacos"" were such a thing. My heritage, my California upbringing, my Hispanic family friends growing up, have all led me to a fascination, love, and appreciation of arguably Mexico's most emblematic dish, the beloved taco.  Which is why I had goosebumps walking into Taqueria el Barrio on its third day of operation, a new addition to Packard's Corner in Brighton. It's a start-up by the owner of well-known restaurants Bergamot (Sommerville) and Bisq (Cambridge) - neither of which has any Mexican showings. So I was, indeed, curious.  The line to wait was long, roughly 5 minutes. There was some confusion of wait staff and order takers as to who's orders were who's coming out of the open kitchen - notably because they do not take people's names at the time of paying at the register.  The dining area was clean. There are four (4) different salsas/sauces to be added to your dishes if you are so daring. For my palate, two were medium hot and two were spicy... but by New England standards, you would consider them to all fairly spicy. And for those that go too far with adding the heat, there's ice water available to go and guzzle down.  Go big or go home - I got four tacos: Asada, Carnitas, El Pastor (which is citrus-marinated carnitas), and Pollo. I consider these the ""four basic taco-food groups"" when trying new tacos.  By far, the Asada and Carnitas/El Pastor were the shining beacons. The Pollo was a bit too bland on my flavor meter... at least compared to the others on my plate. Guacamole for miles piled on my tacos! That was a surprise, and even more surprising - it almost overwhelmed my flavors. None had a notable marinate or sauce that made the tacos truly sing their highest possible notes. However, solid performances all around.  My friend got one asada torta (think a taco inside a bread bun), and that was loaded with the flavors I admittedly wished was packed into my tacos!  This place has the potential to become taco greatness. A few ""newbie"" kinks to work out, so I won't hold that against them until I update my review in a few months. They deserve your try. I'm betting most people will love them, and adore their decor, and enjoy their $3.25 taco prices, which for the size they come in, is a steal in Boston","Name: Taco Mex Restaurant; Review: I love coming here, i live in peabody and make it a point to drive here at least 4 times a month, they have best tacos, shrimp ceviche and a huge menu that i havent been able to get thru but i will.

Name: Chilacates Centre St; Review: As someone who’s in love with Austin Texas and it’s plethora of taco options, I’m always on the lookout for a great place to get tacos. Chilacates, both locations that I’ve been to (Centre street and Amory street in JP), are amazing. Prices are reasonable. Quick, chill environment with a small storefront.  The biggest thing for me, homemade corn tortillas. To die for.  I’ll often stop by here when they open at 9 on the weekends and get a breakfast taco (just eggs and pico) and a papas con chorizo, smother them both in the green and orange hot sauces. Just watch as they magically disappear from your plate.  My other favorites are the Al Pastor tacos as well as the hidden gem: Tamales. Their tamales are amazing. They usually have 3 kinds, pork chicken or cheese. Just get one or two to add to your taco smorgasbord, open those bad boys up, smother in pico and both hot sauces, enjoy!  Though I’m more of a taco guy, I have friends who swear by their burritos and I can say with confidence that this is the best torta I’ve ever had. Usually at a Mexican place, I think it’s a waste of time if you’re not getting tacos, but for real, you can’t go wrong with a torta.  I’m enamored with this place, so, so glad to have it nearby.  Staff at Chilacates, Thank You

Name: Taqueria El Barrio; Review: My wife and I learned of this place quite by chance. She being from Mexico and me having lived in Mexico for three years, we are always on the hunt for authentic Mexican tacos. This place checks all the boxes. First, the food quality is exceptional. Second, the restaurant offers a variety of tacos with your choice of corn (soft or hard) or flour. They also offer tortas (Mexican sandwich) and a selection of flavored waters. We both had a pescado (fish) taco. My wife and another al pastor while I opted for the chicharrón (crispy pork skin). Definitely get the chicharrón if you like pork - it’s amazing. We shared a torta with carnitas. It was delicious, and full as we were toward the end we did not leave anything on our plate. This was worth the drive to Boston from the Merrimack Valley area.

Name: Taquería Jalisco; Review: DINNER REVIEW  Taco bout a great find!  I came to Taqueria Jalisco on the recommendation of a friend who lives in Eastie and boy am I glad I did. I just got back from a week-long trip to Mexico and I have to say...these tacos were better than any tacos I had in Mexico.  They were full of juicy, flavorful meat (I had one chicken, one steak, and one marinated pork) and topped with cilantro and onion. The steak was my favorite but they were all good. Then you have the option of one of their three multi-colored salsa (green, brown, yellow) with varying degrees of spiciness to add to your tacos (none were too spicy for me but those who don't like spice should stick to the green). The rice and beans that came with it were also great.  I also had a pork tamale which was a good tamale but I think the tacos were still my favorite.  The place is tiny so you may have to wait a bit for a table (we waited 5 minutes only) and the service is great (the servers are so nice!). You can easily get FULL for under $20 which is great too.  I will definitely be back

Name: Dorado Tacos Boston; Review: Pros: Good chips. Good salsas - tomatillo is on point. Black beans are wonderful. Reasonable prices. Friendly staff. Cons: Limited seating. Limited menu.  Dorado Tacos features Baja Mexican food, which is a different slice of Mexican cuisine than I'm used to eating. You'll find this is a contrast to Yucatan or central Mexican foods. Cemitas are not exactly Tortas. Overall, this is good food at a great price. If you like Dorado Tacos, check out Ole in Cambridge

Name: Audubon; Review: This is an absolutely amazing gem for me to find in the fenway area and personally not only do I love the food here but the atmosphere created by the owners and staff help elevate the entire dining experience.  The owners Riley and Michael are an amazing and creative team and it shows through their menu and daily specials. Everytime I go it seems that there is something new to try from taco tuesdays to daily specials which sometimes includes cocktails! Not to mention their regular menu is out of this world.  Everything you order off the menu you can taste that it is fresh and never frozen. You can really appreciate the work they’ve put into making the food when even the chips for chips and guac is made from scratch.  So I’ve gone a few times now and I have to say the chicken katsu slider is probably one of my favorite items so far from the regular menu. I’ve also tried the taco tuesday menu and now Audubon is by far my favorite place to go for taco tuesdays. The san diego fish taco and the barbacoa quesadillas are my favorites and I’d highly recommend you give those a try.  From the ambiance to the exceptional quality of the food and the wholesome service the owners provide I have absolutely no complaints with my experience here and look forward to coming back and trying everything from the menu"
Best brunch places in town,"Name: Tavern On the Water; Review: The service was great and for brunch for two we only paid $26. Will come back again
Name: Crispy Crepes Cafe; Review: My favorite place to eat on campus! They have the best scrambled egg in Boston!! I love the soft taste of scrambled egg, and most of other brunch places in local area cook too much. Bacon is also one of my favorite. I usually come here for brunch before class. Egg special is what I always have. The boss is a very nice guy. He makes you feel welcome

Name: Ashmont Grill; Review: I can't say enough about the GREAT BRUNCH I had here!!! Hands down the best Sunday brunch I've had in YEARS. Great food, great service, great drinks; they didn't even blink when I asked them if they could make small modifications to everything we ordered to adjust for allergies. They were busy since it was Sunday brunch, but I'm a really slow eater and my friend and I hadn't seen each other for months and they never tried to rush us. We found parking less than 1 block away.. I left them a hefty, well deserved tip. As I always mention in my reviews when applicable, going to this place supports a small, independently owned local business","Name: Union Bar and Grille; Review: A go to for me. They offer some great deals if you are flexible with time. The brunch is an amazing deal. The coffee is top notch and I have had yummy french toast and a delicious fresh omelette. I think it goes for $10!!! They also offer a early bird dinner special for $30-Three courses and wine! It helps me justify going out during the week. I am not a huge chicken person but my dining partner loved loved their roast chicken. I enjoyed my trout but it lacked flavor. All the servers were super friendly and nice. Good neighborhood place in the south end

Name: Panificio Bistro & Bakery; Review: Settling at 3.5 stars for Panifico. Given it was Sunday brunch time, every place on Charles St was super busy with long lines so we went back to Panifico which had few tables free.  Easily found on main Charles st and so close to Charles MGH station. You order first then you sit with your order nr. Prices here were decent (well, compared to the Bay Area :P) and service was minimal. Good options on the brunch menu from egg dishes, salads, sandwiches and pancakes etc.  The four of us opted for:  - smoked salmon eggs benny. This was really good and not super heavy with good portions. - eggs florentine. Lovely and light vegetarian option. - huevos ranchero. My hubby was content with it tho seemed a bit on the dry side. - chicken sausage hash. Not exactly what the person who ordered it had in mind. She was very disappointed with the huge portion and not so good taste-wise.  Coffee and fresh OJ was decent. Overall the experience was good but nothing to write home about. Would love to try other places in the area
Name: Brownstone; Review: We had just arrived for a weekend in Boston and searched for ""Saturday brunch"" in the area of our hotel (park plaza). I called (10Am) to see if we could get a reservation. We were told that it wouldn't be possible because most reservations would start coming in within the next hour but we could sit at the bar. When we arrived (10:30) the restaurant was virtually empty, and we were seated at a table right away.  Extensive brunch options, are tasty and affordable. The food came out in a timely manner with very large portions. Servers were helpful and kind. Large accommodating space, decent pub like decor.  Though when we left the restaurant was still not at capacity, the crowd was bustling, many large groups. We liked the food so much we went back again two days later for breakfast before we flew out.  I highly recommend
Name: Beacon Hill Hotel & Bistro; Review: Absolutely flawless brunch. The menu is small, but diverse, without getting too crazy with any sort of fusion dishes. My girlfriend and I split the following: Muesli: Delicious. Not too sweet muesli base with cooked cinnamon apples, figs, and I believe some pears. Topped with fresh strawberries and a very high quality low-fat yoghurt. French Toast: Phenomenal. Pullman loaf cooked PERFECTLY so that the outside is browned and the inside is set up like a custard. Topped with cooked cinnamon apples and spiced creme fraiche and light amber maple syrup on the side. Mushroom Omelette: Again, perfect. Eggs cooked perfectly and mushrooms not soggy. Served with french fries.  One of those rare places that decides to cook a limited number of things, but cooks them flawlessly. All the above food cost $40 in total.

GO THERE","Name: Trophy Room; Review: Best South End Sunday Brunch in Boston Boston restaurants are numerous, on nearly every corner and intersection. In the South End, residents and visitors have copious choices, so we would like to point out a very pleasant experience we had this past weekend: Sunday brunch at The Trophy Room on Chandler Street (inside the Chandler Inn Hotel) at Berkeley Street. First impressions are important, and we received positive feedback as soon as we opened the door to the restaurant. The staff all greeted us so warmly that we couldn’t help but feel welcome! The host, with a big smile and a warm greeting offered us a window table, but we declined, preferring to sit at the 12-seat bar instead. The lounge has plenty of window tables, probably seating 40 or so. The comfortable-looking dining room is all banquettes, seating about 24. Fred, the bartender, smiled and immediately said “Hell-o” and when asked, recommended the very first item on the brunch menu: Eggs Caribe. The Eggs Caribe is a “Melt-In-Your-Mouth” delicious breakfast: grilled English muffin topped with lump crabmeat, poached eggs and topped with a chef-made creamy hollandaise sauce, served with leafy spinach and “breakfast potatoes”. These potatoes were not your usual home fries, but hot, crispy and yummy tidbits – and didn’t have that “Left-On-The-Grill-Forever” taste. The menu description for this dish did not do it justice - it was superb! We also highly recommend the steak and eggs dish: a 6-oz. portion of Boston strip steak cooked perfectly – moist, succulent and scrumptious. It comes complete with eggs and choice of toasted breads. Beverages are an important part of any Sunday brunch – and The Trophy Room didn’t disappoint here: the Berkeley Bellini had a nice twist, using grapefruit juice instead of the traditional OJ, with Mathilde Peche liqueur and sparkling Rose – luscious! The traditional Bloody Mary, made with bartender Patrick’s own recipe was not overly spicy, but delivered a nice kick – recommended. Coffee was hot, fresh and good – what else could you ask for, to start your day. The rest of the menu featured 6 breakfast dishes, 3 salads, 3 soups, 4 sandwiches and 5 luncheon items. We look forward to returning to The Trophy Room to investigate the rest of the Sunday brunch menu. For Sunday brunch in the South End of Boston, we give The Trophy Room 5 stars

Name: Sky Restaurant; Review: If you're ever looking for a place to hold a Sunday brunch for a special event, THIS IS THE PLACE!!! Perfectly prepared portions of breakfast and lunch items adorn the buffet room. Choose from scrambled eggs to fish picatta...And don't forget the salad options - usually three or more. And then there's the additional differentiators you rarely find - a make your own Bloody Mary bar (choose from six or more base options), and a CHOCOLATE FOUNTAIN. For Mother's Day and Father's Day brunch, make your reservation at least 6-8 weeks in advance!!

Name: Asana; Review: Fantastic food and impeccable service. My girlfriend and I have been here for brunch, lunch, and dinner. Their staff is incredibly friendly and knowledgeable. And the seafood is amazing! It is a bit pricy, but definitely will impress a date. The booth tucked away in the middle of the restaurant adds for a nice romantic feel to this luxurious hotel restaurant. Too bad they don't serve their brunch buffet anymore, it was the best I've ever tasted"
Any gourmet burger joints?,"Name: Regina Pizzeria; Review: This review is NOT about the Pizza. The pizza is standard american style pizza with no specialties but overpriced.  This review is about the way they treat their customers. It was my 1st time visit Regina after they were voted on tripadvisor for the best pizzeria in the U.S. I didn´t pay much attention to the menu since I was gonna to order two slices and I trusted them. So I ordered one gourmet and one single topping (I didn't know at that time). When I went to the counter, the girl asked what kind of pizza I ordered, I told her that I wasn´t sure. She said okay and immediately pushed some button and it showed $9.10 for two slices. Then I asked her how was that possible. They have a meal of two gourmet slices plus a soda for $8.90 and she asked for $9.10 for two slices she wasn´t sure. So she went back to check with her coworker. Then she modified it to $8.50. I thought that since it is only 40 cents in different, then I ordered the meal of two gourmet slices. Later while I was eating, I took a look at the menu board and notice that the price for 1 topping is $3.95 and $4.25 for gourmet. Since I order one slice of 1 topping and one slice of gourmet, the price should be $8.20 instead of $8.50. [All prices are listed as before tax].  Business is business, I felt that the staffs there just tried to fool me and charge me for being a new customer who is not familiar with the price. Not even mention that they gave me the least covered slice in the remainings. This is the last time for me to this place
Name: 5 Napkin Burger; Review: Disappointed all around.  The best part of the ""burger"" was the bun and the toppings.  I ordered online to pick up. The website told me estimated pick up time -  30 minutes.  I got there 30 minutes later to a near empty restaurant. Don't know what would take 30 minutes to make my fairly simple order of Bacon Cheddar Burger and cheese tots.  Well the order must have not taken 30 minutes and was sitting on the bar there for me when I got in there,and 2 minutes later when I got to my hotel room, the burger and the cheese tots were cold.  Burger was warm, the tots were legitimately COLD.  Other reviews say how huge the burgers are.  Mine was not so big.  It is not one of those big fat juicy burgers that is round and dripping with juice.  It was one of those flat thin burgers that reminded me of those frozen pre made burgers that were served from the food service, thrown on the grill frozen and just cooked from there.  The website allows you to choose your burger either medium or well-done.  I put in the notes on my order medium rare.  The burger was not hardly cooked.  It wasn't medium rare.  It was basically seared on both sides of the thin wimpy burger and then raw on the middle. The meat quality was poor since it was raw, I had to pick out all sorts of grisle and uncooked meat.  Then the Bacon Cheddar burger further disappointed.   There was no bacon on the burger. I think the cook was perhaps confounded by the infrequent ""medium-rare"" request and forgot about topping the Bacon Cheddar burger with bacon. To my dismay, the cold tots, numbered only 11 in a paper container that looked not so different from a fast food restaurant. With the paltry serving size, the cold 11 tots looked pathetic in the large container. The sesame brioche and toppings on the burger were satisfactory.  The raw white onion on top was nice flavor and mild, and sliced nice and thin.  The butter lettuce seemed fresh and clean.  The cheese was melted  and the bun toasted.  But boil it all down and you have a burger that is 3x the price of a fast food burger, that is not even as good as a fast food burger, and all for what?  Cause there is a burger fad that these guys had a vision to create the perfect burger?  I can see what they had envisioned, and perhaps another location of theirs has it mastered, but the location in Back Bay, Boston missed by a long shot.  Save your extra $10 and get a better fast food burger at any of the crappy little chains
Name: Cobblestone Café; Review: I thought this restaurant isn't everything people are screaming about,  the medium burger my son ordered was rare and he asked for no tomatoes. He said the flavor was good but only ate half the burger. (Because it was rare) if you claim to be the best burger in town (which most of boston does) than be the best burger in town! That means from the beginning to the end, get the order right, cook it right, and serve it right. My husband ordered a well cooked burger and it was pink! Good job guys. So not impressed and will not return nor will recommend

Name: Boston Burger Company; Review: This was my third time visiting a Boston Burger company and I am really sad about my experience yesterday.  I arrived around 6:45PM and the place wasn't very busy.  My friend and I sat down and ordered a beer, my beer was flat but I understand it happens sometimes so I didn't say anything.  I ordered the Kitchen Sink Burger priced at $15.50 cooked medium.  When it arrived it was cooked well done and didn't look like the colossal burger I remembered.  The burger resembled a typical fast food burger with a slim patty, and small fixings.  I was debating on whether or not to tell the waitress but I figured, there are only 5 people in the restaurant and if the kitchen is putting is out weak burgers without being busy it is better to not say anything.  I ate half my burger, told the waitress about the burger and told her not to worry.   I ordered a Freak Shake which was excellent but again very expensive.   After paying $50.00 for a burger, shake, beer, and tip I visited the bathroom which was filthy.  Paper towels were all over the floor, the toilet clogged, urine was on the floor, and the sink was a mess.  Again, only 5 people in the restaurant!   I really wanted to experience the Boston Burger Company I remembered but sadly it was a bad night","Name: Boston Burger Co-Davis Sq; Review: The burgers are amazing!  The burger patty itself is quality!  Then you have all these fun combinations. Some more suite my taste while others are more for a college student coming off a bender.  I had Green Monster with Mac & Cheese (grilled) my wife made her own.  We also had the nacho fries.  No doggie bag for me  The Green Monster and the nacho fries had really good pico de gallo. There only a few places in MA with good pico de gallo, this is one of them.  The menu is straight forward; however, they allow for substitutions and cusotmer.  Lots of table turn over, but there is no rush... Yes they have outdoor seating.  Convenient location Its is right across the street form the Davis Sq T station.  There is street parking
Name: Tasty Burger; Review: I maintain that there are basically two burger places in downtown Boston. One is the Boston Burger Company, which is known for their absurdly expensive and quite frankly ridiculous burgers (which I'm not knocking, it's just - have you ever actually TRIED to eat their 420 Burger?) The other is Tasty Burger, which is a significantly more sane and down-to-earth diner environs in which you can enjoy a normal burger.  It's basically a bar, really, and it minces no words about it. You go there to get a big cold beer, eat a (really tasty) Big Tasty burger with a side of absurdly greasy onion rings, and finish it off with a tiny pie. Who cares, it's a good burger joint, it doesn't try to be anything else. It's also one of the only places around here that actually serves Cheerwine. You remember Cheerwine? Where else can I get it around here? Who supplies these people? These are the everyday mysteries that vex me.  Their chicken parm sandwich ""suffers"" from an INCREDIBLE amount of cheese stretch, which did mildly incapacitate my girlfriend when I took her there. It's a bit of a choking hazard if you're unprepared. Just a word of warning.  The food is reasonably priced for the portions, and I guarantee you won't walk away hungry. The tables have a wide variety of different sauces and stuff, like a big basket thing full of pretty much all the condiments, including the ones that don't make any sense to use on any of their menu items. The fry spice blend is quite good. Don't overdo it, though, it can get overpowering.  They also sell merch, like some kind of weird clothing brand. I don't get who it's marketed towards (the Cracker Barrel business model does NOT work in cities,) but I have to admit that a knockoff Supreme box logo shirt that says ""Big Tasty"" on it is a hilarious novelty.  You can buy a whole sack of hamburgers for like 30 dollars, give or take. That's insane. Review over
Name: Beta Burger; Review: Really good burgers. They really talk up the sous vide thing, and I wish I could tell the difference, but it would seem that it should be a bit healthier. Staff are really nice and it seems to be locally run. There's a nice lady there who I think is the owner and always looks for genuine feedback. Better than most fast food
Name: LoLa Burger Boston; Review: Good Hamburger, crispy meat on the outside and juicy inside, a classic but tasteful bread, the cheese of your choice (My choice was Blue Cheese). Some purple onions, Tomato in a wheel with Gherkin and Lettuce. A classic but delicious hamburger. As is as one wants it.  I promise that in the next opportunity he took a picture of the Hamburger and published it.  La / Lo Burgue a restaurant where I can return to eat again.
Name: B.GOOD; Review: I'm somewhat surprised at the number of positive reviews for the B. Good burger.  The bun it came on was surprisingly good, though somewhat earthy in flavor, with more chew than your typical commercial burger bun.  While the bun/patty ratio seems good, the fact that the bun doesn't squish the way that a typical commercial bun would, means that eating the burger is rather messy.  Yes, the burger comes wrapped in paper, but because the burger itself is rather small and dense, the wrapping does less to keep one's hands clean than to get in one's way while trying to eat it.  I ordered the mushroom Swiss burger, which was tasty enough, though the mushrooms were cold.  And I mean, straight-out-of-the-refrigerator cold, which was an unpleasant contrast to the warm bun, hot patty, sauteed onions, and melted Swiss.  Yes, the burger tasted somewhat more ""fresh"" and homemade than other fast food burgers, but then, that's not really what a fast food burger is about.  Anyway, this place caters to a crowd that wants to feel that they are eating healthy/healthier options and I think B. Good delivers on that front.  However, to compare this place to Tasty Burger is just so, so, deeply incorrect","Name: Boston Burger Co-Davis Sq; Review: The burgers are amazing!  The burger patty itself is quality!

Name: UBURGER; Review: This place was awesome before hamburger joints became trendy.  Great quality ingredients and just SO delicious.  The frappes are also the best.  I can only ever do 2 of the 3 though: fries, frappe, burger.  Never all 3 or I'd never be able to walk again.  I think the Big Pappi Burger is the way to go.  Its always packed, especially during games, and not the fastest place, but so very worth it.  Great deal too, definitely leave full for under $10.  Also you have to love a place that does water cups so you can wash it all down without having to buy a drink.  Their expansion to new locations is just the icing on the cake, now the rest of the city can try some delicious Uburger too

Name: Crazy Good Kitchen (C.G.K ON NEWBURY); Review: I kept seeing CGK posts all over my IG and knew I had to come try, the burgers look insane! Especially had to come since the brand new Newbury location is closer to me than the other location. Its a nice cozy vibe on the inside and is also available for outdoor dining. I got the double trouble burger and the spicy chicken sandwich with buffalo fries. The hot and messy burger which is what I think CGK is known for which looked really good but I think I'll give it a shot when I come back. Still the double trouble burger was fire. Patty was nicely cooked with some pink, bacon was crisp and it added much needed texture. The burnt butter mayo was a good but I wish there was some kind if citrusy sauce that cut some of the fattiness. Juicy and crispy is the minimum you need for a good chicken sandwich and they hit that 100%. Aside from the chicken, the cole slaw felt like an afterthought. For spice level, its not too spicy in my opinion and went nicely with the ranch sauce they added. Overall I'd come back but probably not too often, its good but is a bit heavy and greasy","Name: Noble Roman's Pizza; Review: They make the best specially breaded french fries and onion rings ever. Their hamburgers are also delicious. And they have very friendly customer service...thank you

Name: The Tap Trailhouse; Review: Gourmet Food in a pub atmosphere - almost a 'Gastropub'. Lovely flavors well combined by excellent chef in a real brewpub. The downtown Tap Trailhouse reopened in September with a great new menu that tastes even better than it sounds. A wonderful gourmet twist on New England food sandwiched (literally) between the 'Union Oyster House' and the 'Bell in Hand' near Faneuil Hall. The best Bluefish pate I have tasted and  lovely Lobster Pie. Tasty glazed duck with herbed pease pudding and wonderful grilled trout. For Desert Indian Pudding with creamy Blueberry Gelato and individual Apple Pockets that taste like Tarte Tatin. Amazing range of beers including their own brand

Name: The Burger Bar and A Little Bit More; Review: An inexpensive burger, sandwich, and brunch restaurant that's easy for a quick bite to eat. You can create your own 'Plain Jane' 3oz. burger starting at $3 dollars (best value) , or you can choose one of their signature 5oz burgers. All burgers come with French fries. The burgers are cooked on the flat top griddle, and the french fries are unseasoned. I would eat here again out of convenience, but it's not a restaurant I would go out of my way to eat at

Name: Liberty Diner; Review: Absolutely the atmosphere I was looking for. Very local, multicultural feel. The menu was exactly what you would expect from a local dinner, and the food was excellent. I went simple and got a cheeseburger and fries, but the burger was delicious, and the fries weren't greasy. The cost for my entire meal and tip was $12. I'd absolutely recommend this place for a comfortable, quick, familiar bite to eat

Name: UBURGER; Review: This place was awesome before hamburger joints became trendy.  Great quality ingredients and just SO delicious.  The frappes are also the best.  I can only ever do 2 of the 3 though: fries, frappe, burger.  Never all 3 or I'd never be able to walk again.  I think the Big Pappi Burger is the way to go.  Its always packed, especially during games, and not the fastest place, but so very worth it.  Great deal too, definitely leave full for under $10.  Also you have to love a place that does water cups so you can wash it all down without having to buy a drink.  Their expansion to new locations is just the icing on the cake, now the rest of the city can try some delicious Uburger too"
Vegetarian restaurants nearby,"Name: Boston Burger Co-Boylston; Review: Mocking customers because of food preference (Vegetarian/Vegan)  We ordered 3 VEGETARIAN burgers and got bacon in all the burgers.  When I spoke to the manager about this he told me it was my mistake. According to him a vegetarian burger means the patty is vegetarian but there can be meat toppings in the burger.  I asked him what does the word “burger” mean. Does it mean “A patty” Or “2 buns with 1 patty and some toppings between the buns“  The manager responded that for them Burger means just the patty. Well for rest of the world with common sense and access to Internet the burger means “2 buns 1 patty and some toppings “  The manager walked back and we could see him talking to other servers about us and those servers looked at our table and started laughing.  We were charged for 1 burger instead of 3. By the way, we ordered 3 vegetarian burgers and all 3 burgers had meat in it.  We felt very bad the way we were treated and laughed at by other servers.  It would have been okay if it was a mistake by the cook or server. That happens. People make mistakes, but it is a completely different story when the restaurant blames the customer for their own lack of attention and clarity and on top of that laugh at the customers.  I hope at least BBC is taking food allergies seriously because mistakes with that can be life threatening is not a laughing matter.  I would never recommend this restaurant to any of my vegetarian/vegan/non-vegetarian friends. I can tolerate bad food but it is not okay for me when servers laugh at me and my friends because we are vegetarians/vegan
Name: Punto Rojo; Review: The best Colombian restaurant I have been in this country !! I live in NY and I came to visit Boston and this place really made me happy with its food and good service, the price for the quality and quantity of food is more than perfect !! I looked at many Reviews of restaurants nearby and this was the best and the best choice! All very tasty!
Name: Tavern Road; Review: Came here for a friends birthday dinner and was worried I might not find enough vegetarian food on the menu but ended up not being disappointed.   We had a reservation in advance and the table was ready on time as promised.  The menu is a small plates place and the portion sizes are fairy small so will take at least 3 items to make a meal size portion.  They had about 6-8 items that were vegetarian and because we shared among the table I was able to try pretty much all the options.  The samosa's were good, but lacked more texture in the filling.  The Cauliflower was excellent and the grapes added a pleasant twist.  Overall all the vegetarian items were really good expect for the flatbread/french pizza which was way too salty.  The wait staff was very attentive and the drinks menu had lots of options.  Overall this is a good place to try but can get pricey in larger groups
Name: Gourmet India; Review: I went here because the menu listed several lamb entree options. There's only ""vegetarian or chicken?"" (<= exactly what the guy said, actually...) So that was disappointing. Also, the prices are higher than listed here: huge nono. If I am going to pay $10.50 for a vegetarian entree without a drink, nan, samosas, etc... I better know that before I make the trip over
Name: Brandy Pete's; Review: I was disappointed with their service and food. I am a vegetarian. I was there for lunch. Their menu indicated vegetarian burger can be substituted. So I specifically asked to the waiter to substitute it with one of their burger from the menu and I specifically stated, no meat at all. When he came with the dish, it had bacon strips on it. When I asked to change the dish, he took it inside and just removed the bacon strips. Apart from that, the burger patty tasted very awful. I doubted if the patty was even vegetarian and so I could not eat. So for strict veggie lovers, this place is not for you.  With the food not tasty, service untrustworthy, and pricing sky-high, I am out of this place forever","Name: Cafe Med; Review: As a vegetarian and world traveler, I was so lucky to find Cafe Med in Boston. Cafe Med not only has a wide variety of vegetarian options, they use authentic Greek and Middle Eastern recipes!  I usually order the Spinach Pie and Greek Salad, along with a veggie rollup. Did I mention  that you can stray from the menu and build your own sandwiches and salads? Well you can!  Cafe Med also has a great ambiance with soothing Greek music playing over the sound system and Eclectic decor.  Cafe Med is also a block away from the MBTA's Arlington station on Green line, so its convenient for me to have lunch there during the week.  Every time I leave Cafe Med I feel satisfied and refreshed

Name: Towne Stove and Spirits; Review: Not a good place for vegetarians or people on a schedule, but delightful wine selection. Granted, we were in a large party and clearly not in a rush, but with a 7p reservation and moving at the rate the waitress proposed, we did not get our entrées until after 9p, and two plates were further delayed because they were sent to a concurrent event instead of our table.  As a vegetarian looking at the option of an appetizer or a cheese pizza for dinner, I asked the waitress what other vegetarians had done. Boston is known for catering to people of different eating persuasions, but this menu had little to offer for GF, vegetarians, and the like. Our waitress suggested I order a few sides, or I could have a pasta-veggies dish. I opted for the latter and received small-shell pasta dripping in over-salted and over-peppered butter sauce with a few buttery vegetables and a scant teaspoon of parmesan cheese. Because it was so late by the time we finally ate, I was glad I wasn't very hungry anymore, since the dish was not very good. After paying a whopping $17 for some pasta, I will not go back.  Our waitress was nice, but because the restaurant was ""busy"" that evening (7p Saturday night), the service was quite slow and only when she needed information from us - I don't recall being checked on between when our meals came and when we ordered dessert. I will say my water glass was never less than half full!  That being said, the atmosphere was nice, carnivores enjoyed their dinner, and my $18 glass of wine was lovely
Name: Oasis Vegan Veggie Parlor; Review: The food is really good. The employees and business owners are very kind. This is not a fast food restaurant so be prepared to wait 10 to 15 minutes for your name to be called to grab your clean brown paper bag (with sturdy handles)😍. In my opinion, this small vegan parlor is a great addition to the updated Four Corners location. 👍 Truly. Oasis has such a good neighborhood/inviting community ""get together"" vibe due to the clientele that it tends to attract. It's always a friendly experience... Plus the music makes you want to dance your best afrobeat moves while waiting for your favorite vegan dish of the day... Tho there is likely to be a bit of a wait- I shall return to this place, soon. 😊 P.s. The coconut lentils are a must! 😋 yum yum yu
Name: Pho Boston; Review: Quaint little space, very reasonable prices, and attentive service. The vegetarian pho and stir fry dishes we ordered were delicious and came out fast. One important thing to note is that if we hadn't inquired about it, even the vegetarian dishes we ordered would have been prepared with oyster sauce as almost everything on their menu contains. Appreciated that our server offered to ensure what we ordered would be made truly vegetarian.

Name: Boston Burger Co-Davis Sq; Review: Their veggie patty is delicious, and their burgers are absolutely loaded. I just hate that it costs extra to swap out a meat patty for a veggie one. Also, just as an FYI, the baked beans side (that can come with each burger) is disappointingly not vegetarian.  It's also disappointing that there are absolutely no good vegan options. Would be nice if their veggie patty were also vegan, but that's not the case.  Sometimes a whole burger is a bit too much, but none of their other entrees or appetizers are nearly as delicious. I wouldn't mind if they had a smaller option for their burgers. I feel like I can only come here when I'm ravenous, and most times I'm just not in the hungry for that much food. In any case, I alway leave full and satisfie

Name: Amsterdam Falafelshop; Review: I love this vegetarian option being so close to my work in Davis Square. I love the speed, accessiblity to several toppings, sauces, and how full I feel after but not weighed down as if I had a lot of beef and cheese. They let you pick between the wrap or bowl. I always opt for the bowl! That way I can have more food","Name: Zest Mediterranean Grille; Review: Quick, healthy and affordable. Good for vegetarians. If you're walking from Fenway back downtown (which you should), you will likely pass by this spot soon after you turn back onto Boylston. While everywhere else we saw was crowded (because of St. Patrick's Day crowds), this place was a good find. The food was affordable and quite tasty. It is also much healthier than most of the rest we found. It is also a great spot for vegetarians

Name: Hamersley's Bistro; Review: Five of us went including one with gluten issues and two vegetarians. Everyone was happily accommodated.  Terrific foods. Terrific service. Lively place. I had a corn soup and roast chicken followed by a great dessert. Everything is wonderful. Go.  There's a reason it's been a success for 20 year

Name: Corner Tavern; Review: I love this place and was spoiled to live right around the street. Prices are completely reasonable and they have a full bar. It's downstairs and feels cozy, tucked away. Huge bar with outlets, so you feel welcome to come and work if you're able, or to come and watch the games.  Big menu, yummy bar food, lots for vegetarians, too.  The service is fast and the staff is chill and helpful. It can be loud (with great, buzzing energy) around games, but if you can get there on off hours, you can have the place to yourself"
Gluten-free pizza options,"Name: Real Deal, LLC; Review: This place carries gluten-free options for sandwiches and pizza. This alone is noteworthy--It is really difficult to make gluten-free alternatives. Real Deal deserves kudos for incorporating these options on to their menu. However, after trying them three times now, I can say that they do not have the best gluten-free buns or pizza crust in town. The bun falls apart halfway through eating (I hate sloppy food so this annoys me). The pizza crust stays intact but needs to be cooked longer for my taste--It does not not have that charred look like the normal pizzas. It also comes in one size (and no single-slice option). 3 stars kind of feels harsh, because my fiancee (no allergy) loves Real Deal's regular menu. So, maybe it is 4 stars overall, but I'd say 3 stars specifically for their average tasting g-free options and blase customer service
Name: Davio's Northern Italian Steakhouse; Review: I frequent Davio's often for lunch, mostly because it has absolutely scrumptious gluten-free pizza (which is why it made my list of 11 Best Gluten-Free Restaurants in Boston). So when I heard they were adding an extensive gluten-free brunch menu, I jumped at the opportunity to try it out!  Davio's in Boston's Back Bay is a classy place, white tablecloths included. It's perfect for a fancy girl's brunch, a date, or to take your parents to when they're in town.  We started with the Caesar Salad, which was delicious and came with the most scrumptious parmesean crisps. I love how they were generous with the anchovies - for some reason a lot of restaurants skimp out on those, but their salty texture is so great paired with the romaine lettuce!  My sweet tooth was super excited about the gluten-free french toast and berry plate! Sometimes gluten-free bread can be crumbly or more crisp, but these pieces were soft and thicker - perfect for french toast!  N got the gnocchi with mushrooms and truffle oil. He likes the more earthy flavors so this one was a hit!  Prepare yourselves for the epic dessert tray that comes around as a brunch dessert!  At this point we were happily full, but who can say no to dessert, right? So clearly I opted for the flan and berry plate. No regrets! This dish was so decadent, and the vanilla flavor really stood out in the flan and paired nicely with the tart blackberries.  We experienced great service and impeccable meals during our brunch at Davio's - who has a full non-gluten-free menu as well. They have so many options on their menu, which means you can keep going back and getting something new every time. Plus, they're walking distance from the Public Garden, the South End, and shopping on Newbury Street or in the Prudential Mall! I definitely recommend a trip here whether you're gluten free or not
Name: Tavern in the Square Shrewsbury; Review: Not impressed. Like many have said, the food is overpriced for what it is, but that wasn't even the big issue. My mother has celiac disease and we have to be very careful about where we eat. She ordered gluten free Mac and cheese and the manager himself brought it over and it had a allergy flag in it.  Then a young woman brought some over after him, which looked totally different. We said we hope that it's not gluten free because she's already had been eating the one the manager brought over. The girl was immediately panicked and absolutely certain she had the gluten free Mac and cheese. While she was checking on it someone else brought over my not gluten free Mac and cheese and we knew by looking at it that the one my mother was eating was not the gluten free one. Small mistake maybe we could seriously land someone in the hospital. Allergies are a serious concern for some and the managers of all people should be aware of what they're bringing over to the table, especially since it looks completely different. That manager then went on to blame his expo mistake on the chef. The general manager came over to have us fill out an injury report to make sure their buts were covered. Do not go here if you have a real allergy
Name: Giovanni's Roast Beef and Pizza; Review: Super disappointed in this location. As someone with celiac, finding a pizza shop in the Billerica area that serves any form of a gluten free sandwich or wrap and delivers is incredibly difficult.  I've ordered from Giovanni's twice in the last three weeks and each time they have not had gluten free wraps in stock. I called to cancel the second order today and they told me they do not have them because they have to purchase them. To top it they asked me if I ordered frequently enough for them to order wraps. I told them not to bother, because even if I did it's not reliable.  Please, do not advertise gluten free food as available on your site and not have it in stock. Regardless of whether people order frequently or not, if you advertise having it on your menu and available it should be in stock. There are plenty of non - gluten free items on the menu that I am sure are not ordered frequently that are available
Name: Banyan Bar + Refuge; Review: My boyfriend and I ate here for the first time today and we will never come back. If you have any type of food allergy, do not come here. The level of carelessness and how flippant the staff are to food allergies is unacceptable. The risk of health issues for just OK food isn't worth it.  My boyfriend is a celiac so we ordered only the items that were marked gluten free and he informed our waiter that he is a celiac when we ordered. Another server brought out our food and when he set the food down, I asked him if everything was gluten free and he confirmed that everything was. We noticed that the tuna poke dish that we ordered came on a bed of fried wontons which is not usually GF so we asked our original waiter to confirm whether the wonton chips in the poke was gluten free. He stated unequivocally that the food was gluten free and there was not even any cross contamination. After my boyfriend had already eaten multiple bites, the server came out and informed us that they had served us the wrong tuna poke dish and the one my boyfriend had already eaten was in fact not gluten free.  Given that the food was just average, we decided it wasn't worth the risk to keep eating here. There are so many great restaurants on Tremont so I'd recommend skipping this one","Name: Real Deal, LLC; Review: This place carries gluten-free options for sandwiches and pizza.

Name: Pizza Place; Review: Really Awesome Customer Service I called Pizza Place on Thursday morning because my boss asked me to find a place that could feed over 100 people and that had gluten free options.  Working with the manager Steve we were able to come up with a great combination of salad, regular pizzas, and gluten free pizzas.  The manager delivered over 30 pizzas to our location the next day right on time!!  The pizzas were delicious and Pizza Place went out of their way to make sure we had enough.  Everyone loved it and the food went FAST.  Thank you for  a wonderful experience.  We will definitely use you guys again in the future
Name: Oath Pizza - South Station; Review: Read prior reviews so I was expecting the surly staff and poor service.  Pizza wasn't *started* when I arrived at pick up time.  I don't work here, said the man behind the counter.  Gluten Free Pizza is a crispy rice cracker, very sweet.  The toppings are meager but that's okay because they're basically flavorless.  The peperoni was good!  Pizza is cooked in a commercial version of an Easy Bake Oven.  On the plus side, they have a nifty chart on the website listing all potential allergens and truly, I did not have a reaction to anything.  It started hopefully

Name: Al Dente Ristorante; Review: First, I choose this restaurant because of the raving reviews of their attention to detail for people who are gluten free or have Celiac disease. I personally have Celiac disease, so finding an Italian restaurant that is authentic and understanding of cross contamination is super important to me.  I had the gluten free pasta and gluten free garlic bread. The garlic bread was not what you would imagine; it was more like a dense flat bread. It was worth the purchase though. I had the pasta dish at the top of the house specials page with veal, shrimp, and chicken in a garlic wine sauce. I thought it was rather tasteless and the gluten free pene was nothing better than I could've bought from any grocery store. Pretty disappointing for close to $30. Maybe it's because we came 30 minutes before the kitchen closed? But I felt that we were early enough to not be THAT customer.  Al Dente is my girlfriend and her family's favorite Italian restaurant. I had only been here once before about  year ago. I would try it again, but more because it's safe place I can find sustainance for myself and that it has awesome food for people without Celiac disease. I wouldn't return simply to enjoy their food on my own though.  Celiac friendly? Yes. Delicious? Meh.

Name: Pastoral ARTisan Pizza + Kitchen + Bar; Review: The wife, a friend of ours and I had lunch at Pastoral earlier today. We arrived just past one and walked into what was a fairly busy restaurant which was about 60%-70% full and were promptly seated. We were hungry and looked forward to our meal there.  The wife has celiac and was happy to see that they had gluten-free crusts available at a $2 surcharge which we happily went for. She ordered a gluten-free, pepperoni pizza ($17), our friend got the Blance one ($16) and I went with their Proscuitto one ($18). We also ordered a few beers and a cocktail for the wife.  Service was painfully slow. We waited at least 15 minutes for our drink orders to be placed and at least another 10-15 for our drinks to finally arrive. Luckily, by that point, our pizzas were nearly ready and arrived a few instants later.  The pizzas, gluten-free and regular, were all pretty tasty and we didn't have any soggy or burnt issues that other reviews have mentioned.  However, at least in my case, the prosciutto was just three small pieces and while it was pretty good, it definitely wasn't even close to being worth $18. Maybe $14 on a good day, and especially for a so-called lunch menu.  Our bill for the three, single sized pizzas, the two beers and the cocktail topped $85+ which is pretty damn pricey for lunch. Had this been the best Naples-style pizza in town, then maybe that would have been okay but they have nothing on Posto (Somerville) or Gran Gusto (Cambridge) and again, like I said, this was the lunch hour were people want a quick, cheap and small meal, which definitely wasn't.  On the upside the decor is neat and the craft beer selection and cocktails pretty solid. Plus it's in Fort Point which is another plus, especially on a nice day like today where the windows were opened. If they were able to bring the prices down and improve the service, I'd totally give them another shot

Name: Al Dente Ristorante; Review: First, I choose this restaurant because of the raving reviews of their attention to detail for people who are gluten free or have Celiac disease. I personally have Celiac disease, so finding an Italian restaurant that is authentic and understanding of cross contamination is super important to me.  I had the gluten free pasta and gluten free garlic bread. The garlic bread was not what you would imagine; it was more like a dense flat bread. It was worth the purchase though. I had the pasta dish at the top of the house specials page with veal, shrimp, and chicken in a garlic wine sauce. I thought it was rather tasteless and the gluten free pene was nothing better than I could've bought from any grocery store. Pretty disappointing for close to $30. Maybe it's because we came 30 minutes before the kitchen closed? But I felt that we were early enough to not be THAT customer.  Al Dente is my girlfriend and her family's favorite Italian restaurant. I had only been here once before about  year ago. I would try it again, but more because it's safe place I can find sustainance for myself and that it has awesome food for people without Celiac disease. I wouldn't return simply to enjoy their food on my own though.  Celiac friendly? Yes. Delicious? Meh. Go cook your own Udi's pasta and save $30

Name: Giovanni's Roast Beef and Pizza; Review: Super disappointed in this location. As someone with celiac, finding a pizza shop in the Billerica area that serves any form of a gluten free sandwich or wrap and delivers is incredibly difficult.  I've ordered from Giovanni's twice in the last three weeks and each time they have not had gluten free wraps in stock. I called to cancel the second order today and they told me they do not have them because they have to purchase them. To top it they asked me if I ordered frequently enough for them to order wraps. I told them not to bother, because even if I did it's not reliable.  Please, do not advertise gluten free food as available on your site and not have it in stock. Regardless of whether people order frequently or not, if you advertise having it on your menu and available it should be in stock. There are plenty of non - gluten free items on the menu that I am sure are not ordered frequently that are available"
Are there Kosher delis in the area?,"Name: MC Kitchen; Review: Simply outstanding. I appreciate that they are Jewish-friendly and recently became kosher certified, and their creative vegan menu is inspiring. The staff behind the counter are super friendly, and they even were serving Discover Vegans’ steak & cheese vegan pastries. The prices here are consistent with everywhere else within Time Out Market. It’ll be exciting to see what else they add to the menu in the future
Name: The Algonquin Club; Review: It was an interesting step back in time in the back Bay area. Really enjoyed my short time in the area
Name: Thinking Cup; Review: Due to covid19 orders are asked to be placed online before coming into the store.  Well, I did that and apparently I ordered from the wrong location.  When i was given the link it was for the Hanover location,  but online it placed the order through 85 Newbury.  Something told me to check via telephone to make certain.  Sure enough my gut instinct was right.  I called the the Newbury location and I was told our order is there. When I came in the girls were so helpful and sweet that when i told them about the mix up their manager gave me 2 free punch cards for the trouble of not being helped or offered by the Hanover location that they could make my coffees.  My boyfriend and I are  from So Cal and this is our 1st east coast trip and this by far has made our trip beautiful.  We started in CT , then RI and service there is very cold . Thank you 85 Newbury THINKING CUP TEAM FOR your kindness,  great service and making my trip worth it. . I love their Hazelnut latte with oatmilk.  Went back 2x and also ordered the bacon cheddar scone, yummy and chocolate nutella croissant. All delis

Name: Exodus Bagels; Review: I had almost given up on trying to find a bagel in MA that measures up to NY standards. Outside of NY metro area, these are the best bagels I've had. Also the best challah I've ever had from anywhere. Their pandemic setup with online ordering and pickup is very quick, easy and felt safe.  I ordered plain, everything, and dark rye bagels. Pretty much no remaining hole, which is good for sandwiches. Cutting into it, I was surprised to see more/larger air gaps inside than I am accustomed to. But upon eating, it really had the right amount of chew and the crust was just right. It really just tastes like a quality NY bagel. I had practically given up on trying to find a bagel in MA that measures up to NY quality. I've tried Bagelsaurus, Rosenfelds, Iggy's, Bagel World... you name it. All disappointing IMO. After living in Queens for a couple years, I've been spoiled.  The everything bagel was my favorite. For the dark rye, the rye flavor was on the milder side. I could have used a little more, but at least it wasn't overpowering.  I also ordered challah, which you can only get on Fridays, and that was superb. When I first saw it, I was concerned perhaps it was baked too long because it looked a little dark, but it was perfect. Just perfect flavor and texture. Supple but sturdy, excellent crust, sweet but not too sweet. This is one of the few loaves of bread I would not hesitate to pay the hefty $9 price.  I also ordered the chicken liver pate... which is reminiscent of chopped liver but a little different. It's smooth like a pate, and seems to be a bit heavy on the schmaltz and the salt. It's enjoyable, but I'll probably skip this one in the future. It's good and worth a try, but I gotta warn the purists. If you want really good classic chopped liver, IMO you're better off getting it from Michael's Deli or Mahmelah's.  I also got the smoked salmon which was good. It's Acme brand, which IMO is pretty much as good as it gets except for Barney Greengrass and Zabars in NYC. At $12/8oz it's a very fair price, too. You can save a couple bucks getting the 8 oz Nova Pieces at Trader Joe's, which despite the TJ label I'm pretty sure is also sourced from Acme, but this seemed more tender and the slices were bigger pieces
Name: Derne Street Deli; Review: I've been going here for the past 5 years. This is your casual sit in or take out spot. The staff is very friendly and humble. They have a Mediterranean fusion going on. and their portion sizes are pretty big. I'm always really full after I'm finished with my dish. A few of the dishes I tried:  -a Greek style falafel sandwich with tzaziki sauce (very tasty with fresh pita) -chicken salad sandwich (they don't skimp out on the chicken) - Cheeseburger and fries (delicious) -Veggie Omelette with Cheese (pepper, onion, mushrooms absolutely YES! I'm an omelette freak) - Pizza (go for the Greek pizza with olives and feta) - egg, cheese, and turkey on a bagel (breakfast to GO) -Chocolate Chip cookies (baked fresh every day) :)  They're exactly the type of small family owned business you'd want to keep going to
Name: Inna's Kitchen - Boston Public Market; Review: In all fairness, this wasn't quite what we were looking for. We were looking for brunch with GF DF offerings. This is a tiny Jewish deli with very limited seating. Much better suited to take out. I was pleased to be able to order GF DF Challah French Toast, but was disappointed that they were out of the cinnamon swirl. That being said, the Pastrami hash was very good & my family enjoyed their sandwiches & wedge fries.  I'd recommend it for lunch, but not so much for breakfast.  Excellent fresh squeezed OJ was a big plus
Name: Derne Street Deli; Review: Over the past few weeks I have tried a wide variety of options from their menu.  I have thoroughly enjoyed everything I've had to date.  Their Mediterranean Chicken Wrap is a very popular item.  The pita is soft, fresh, and warm.  The grilled chicken is seasoned just right.  The tzatziki is not very garlicky, but adds just the right base.  The lettuce, tomatoes, and onions are always fresh.  Their Pollo Parmigiana sub is amazing.  The sub roll smells and tastes  like it was just baked.  The blend of provolone and mozzarella cheeses above and below the chicken adds just the right amount of stretch when taking a bite.  The chicken and sauce tie it all together.  I could go on.  You have to try this place.  It's reasonably priced and definitely a great value","Name: Exodus Bagels; Review: I had almost given up on trying to find a bagel in MA that measures up to NY standards.

Name: Country Butcher & Deli; Review: I just moved to the area and was glad to find this place. Great selection of meat and seafood as well as phenomenal made to order sandwiches! I bought a couple briskets, multiple steaks, as well as chicken. Everything was great! I'd would totally recommend stopping by for your BBQ and lunch time needs

Name: Lunch Box Deli; Review: I would give 6 stars if possible. Always a generous amount of fresh ingredients including many choices of great breads & rolls.  The staff members get to know the large number of ""regulars"" and make them feel at home.  Nice seating area & always spotless.  The cashier, Mimi, and manager, Faith, are particularly friendly, and the owners make sure that catering deliveries go out just as ordered & on time.  The lunch platters are beautiful, & my company's employees are always delighted with them. Thank you, Lunch Box Deli, for being a great neighbor

Name: Derne Street Deli; Review: Solid lunch spot. Sure, the pizza is cheap, but it's a great place for sandwiches, too. Portions are pretty big for a ~$6.50 sub/sandwich, and there are good options of build-your-own. Heard through the grapevine that they'd recently changed management, but I've only been in the area for 2 weeks so far so I can't confirm big changes myself. Just from my two visits, it's a nice cafe with typical lunch seating and a great location. Plus, call-ahead is available and quite effective for getting through the line quickly! I definitely recommend them

Name: KT Grill; Review: Place is horrible. They try to get you to come in by making you think it's a nice restaurant with their sign but it's just a deli in a supermarket! RIDICULOUS!

Name: Inna's Kitchen - Boston Public Market; Review: DINNER REVIEW  Inna's had been on my list for a while since it served traditional Jewish food in an artisanal food space (the Boston Public Market). I had heard you have to get the shakalatkes (shakshuka plus latkes, a very enticing concept) so I, of course, ordered those plus a falafel pita. Service was quick and we sat down with our food pretty quickly.  The falafel pita was good, the falafel tasted fresh, as did the toppings. I would get that one again. However, the shakalatkes were a little disappointing. I felt like the shakshuka took over the whole thing and it was just the sauce overpowering the soggy patties of potatoes. I think a larger and crispier latke would have provided a better overall eating experience.  I would come back for the falafel, not for the shakalatke

Name: Bagelville; Review: I had a really great pastrami bagel from here and I would recommend if you want a fantastic bagel! Then again, I may have just been ridiculously hungry..

Name: Amsterdam Falafelshop; Review: Awesome Falafel shop now in Kenmore square in addition to their Davis square location.  Finally a place to get good and quick falafels and french fries in town.  I have been waiting for a place like this for a while after going to Maoz and other shops with similar concepts.  The self serve toppings are great and lots of options that I have never seen before but work really well.  The prices are reasonable and this location is bigger then the Davis so there is more space to sit.  Overall a must try if you are craving falafel"
Halal food delivery nearby,"Name: Chicken And Rice Guys; Review: For the price, the taste and portion size are top notch. I've been to the Halal Guys in NY, and maybe because this is a store where they can keep fresh ingredients, but I felt this was much better.  We had the Halal Chicken with rice combo plate, and the chicken was juicy and tender. I also loved the broad sauce selection, which again seemed a great improvement to the packaged sauce that the Halal Guys give you. Here you can douse your plate with bottles of hot sauce (medium or extra spicy), mint chutney, or garlic white sauce. All of them tasted fresh and delicious.  The person working the cash register had some attitude when we were placing our order, so that would be the one thing I'd dock a star for. But luckily since it's a take and go place we didn't have to deal with too long
Name: The Halal Guys; Review: Halal Guys has stepped up their game during this COVID19 pandemic and have made the necessary changes in order to not only keep their customers safe but also their employees! Bravo. You have to wear a mask in order to step into this establishment. They've also set up a barrier so that you're at least 6 feet away from the staff.  They are still serving up the same, delicious food. Is it the same as the infamous food cart in NYC? Almost. The thing that sets Halal Guys above all other halal places is that red sauce! It's super hot but doesn't mess up the flavor of your food. You don't have to add much to bring on the heat. I love practically drowning my platters with white sauce and adding at least 4 lines of that red sauce. The beef gyro sandwich is also on point. They really fill it up so you get a full sandwich. I also dig how that pita bread is so soft
Name: Shah's Halal Food; Review: Didn't expect it but, Shah's Halal Food was remarkable. Delightful menu items at really good prices, wonderful ambience to unwind at.

Name: Boston Pita Cafe; Review: Not expensive but at the same time not very delicious. The staff were friendly and we talked to them about Halal meat. They have chicken halal shawarma (Noor al- Jabal). Will visit again. It is a small, sweet place, and very much in the mall, and their food is permissible because they use mountain light. But eating them means it is not good, especially the shawarma, and their prices are not expensive

Name: The Halal Guys; Review: I used to live across the street from a Halal Guys in Chicago so I was happy they have one here in Boston. When you compare it to other fast-casual chains like Cava, Sweet Green, or Chipotle, it's definitely more ""bare bones"" and less fancy. They definitely don't have a ""health"" equity and they don't have many options. But dang this place is delicious. I always get the regular combo platter which comes with beef and chicken, yellow rice, lettuce, and tomatoes. It's also a significant portion for the price which I appreciate.  Servers are friendly but there's not much seating so better to-go than eat-in.  Come in for a quick bite and get the white sauce and a little spicy (it's VERY spicy and I tend to like spicy)  Share review Write an update Edit revie
Name: Shah's Halal Food; Review: Very bad! I placed an order with them through uber eats. I ordered beef kofta over rice, chicken sandwich and fries. I was actually quite excited to try this food, but they never sent me the chicken sandwich or the fries. They didn’t even call me to tell me that they ran out or something. They didn’t even give me the beef kofta over rice and gave me a chicken over rice instead. I listed the sauces I wanted and they gave their sauces instead. It was so spicy that I couldn’t even eat it. I had to ask for a refund through uber eats. I wish I had a better experience. The reviews you see about them here are actually true!

Their pizza is also yummy. Everything is also halal

Name: Teriyaki House; Review: I could eat here for the rest of my life. The spicy chicken bowl with lo mein is heaven when you have a hang over. People complain about delivery but all you need to do is COMMUNICATE. They come to my house so often they call me to come down before they even pull up. Order wrong just give them a call and they will accommodate you. Faster delivery include the tip on the card and you can grab your food and go. Need faster pick up use grubhub. Bubble tea is yummy. Smoothies are filling. Location is small but lively

Name: The Halal Guys; Review: Overpriced and average to low quality. I only ever had halal guys in NYC for roughly $5-6. I ordered today for the 1st time in Boston from the new fast food storefront that opened up and I got a mixed regular bowl, fries, and 2 orders of baklava. My total was around $25. When I opened my order and expected at least 2 regular pieces of baklava per order, I found 1 small piece for $2.45 each. They were in separate boxes, so definitely no mix up - 1 small piece per 1 order. The baklava was dry and tasted like a bad version of Greek baklava rather than Arab baklava. Even in NyC (with higher prices), baklava this size doesn’t cost this much, and we are talking about top of the line, in a $$$$ expensive restaurant, maybe you’d pay $2.50 per large piece. After I saw the baklava in my order, the rest of the order didn’t matter anymore, as my first impression was pure disappointment! The fries were terrible (worse than McD), I threw them out. Pictures of baklava attached

Name: The Halal Guys; Review: Yay, so happy now they have franchised and in Boston.  If you do not know about the original location. See the Halal Guys on 53rd and 6th in New York City. One of Yelp's most reviewed locations.  Simple, affordable, tasty.  I like the combo plate and get plenty of sauce to go if you do not plan on finishing it there. Watch out for the hot sauce, it is as it has always been. Not for the ""mild"" hot sauce folks. You should just avoid it all together if you can't take the heat.  As far as I can tell, it is using the same ingredients and because they've franchised it is only as consistent as the food freshness turn over. Granted you're not getting the NYC authentic feeling as you did waiting in line and purchasing a $5 plate of goodness. Recently the cart locations have raised their prices to $8. Boston location's price is about $11 and some change with the tax included. IMHO this is a fair price since they have to pay for rent, and hopefully paying the workers a fair wage, etc.  PS w/o these guys, there wouldn't be a chicken and rice guys, they put halal chicken and rice on the map and main stream, but to be fair chk & rice guys were first to market in Bosto"

Name: All-Star Bar & Grill; Review: Hotel food. Not bad if you want something delivered to your room. As a Bar & Grill it is lacking. Food was cold. Pulled pork sandwich was soggy. Again, not bad hotel food. Not a Bar & Grill. Manager did notice food was uneaten and took it off the bill. Still left hungry
Name: Hana Saki Japanese Steahouse & Sushi Bar; Review: went there for Mother/Daughter time since my daughter came down from the cape and we were moved 3 times from the grill and was seated by at another grill alone and then when our food came so did the birthday party that reserved it and felt bad for the party and felt rushed to finish up, the food was good but i think will find another place to go
Name: Dates and Olives; Review: It was my first Mediterranean food in Boston and my wife and I had a very pleasant experience out there. We ordered a chicken sandwich and brown rice bowl with three toppings. My wife pointed out the portion where they seem to be smaller than other Mediterranean restaurants but for me, the quality and freshness of the food were excellent that the portion fits perfect for me. When we visited the place around noon, it was very chill and quiet place to talk with my wife without disturbance. Highly recommend for local people or newcomers to Brookline/ Brighton area who wants to have healthy food with a quick bite. And last but least the Mango Lassi was the finale","Name: Mediterranean Grill; Review: Our company orders from here at least once a week, and has been a staple for many years.  Large portions make most meals sufficient for two, excellent customer service always, and consistent quality of food.  Fabulous salads with REAL marinated chicken, fresh greens and veggies, home made soups, great wraps and sandwiches.  Always happy when we go here!  Oh, and they deal with our extras and special orders every time
Name: Mediterranean Grill; Review: Can't believe the reviews of this place are so high.  I work on this block, and have eaten dozens of meals here.   I've always just accepted some of the negatives of this place because it's so conveniently located to my office, which is why I still go, despite better offerings in the neighborhood.   Despite their lower ranking, they're still among the highest priced.  Sandwiches and wraps here are generally underfilled and small compared to other places in the area.  The space is standing room only (even before Covid, I think there was one high-top), as it's basically just a deli counter with lower grade pizza offerings.   Today, my roast beef sandwich had cold cuts that not only weren't fresh, but were borderline spoiled.  Sandwich literally smelled like bad cold cuts.  I was starving, and had to throw it out.  Breakfast is the only reliable order here.  Even the stuff they sometimes do well, like Greek wraps, can disappoint, and let's face it, a person ordering a Greek wrap or roast beef sandwich isn't expecting something from the cover of Bon Appetit.   Today was the last straw.   Spoiled food is too much to ignore
Name: Mediterranean Grill; Review: Best chicken kabobs in the city also has the best chicken parmigiana sub better than any north end restaurant. Breakfast burritos are huge and great way to start the day. I would get the chicken cedar salad with fried chicken every day of the week of possible
Name: Zest Mediterranean Grille; Review: Super fresh food, expertly made, in short. I had the  Falafel Plate that comes with three sides. Everything was top-notch. the falafel balls seemed like they just came out of the fryer...still warm and steaming inside. Often at many places these are dry inside. These were moist with a slightly crunch outside, with a delicious flavor, made even more so by the spicy tahini sauce I picked. I had three sides out of what looks like 12 or so choices; a great selection. Everything looked great but I wanted to compare to other places so chose the tabbouleh salad and the fattoush salads, as well as the moussaka. Everything was very fresh with high-quality ingredients IMO. The tabbouleh was delicious, well-balanced and bright with the right amount of lemon juice. The fattoush was delicious and refreshing; I really enjoyed the small amount of mint in it. Finally, the moussaka is something I had not had before. It was delicious with its chick peas and stewed eggplant and tomatoes.  I really appreciate a place like this in general, but especially when traveling when it seems so hard to get fresh, healthy food. This place is a gem. The food and environment is kid-friendly and I can't wait to bring my family back here. Zest, please keep on doing what you are doing!
Name: Mediterranean Grill; Review: got steak & cheese, was OK. steak was good but they put the cheese at the bottom of bread, big mistake when making a steak & cheese!  The right way is you put the cheese on top of the steak while it on the grill, let it melt then fold over in put on sub roll, then you taste cheesy goodness in every bite. wont ever get a steak & cheese from there again","Name: Aceituna Grill; Review: I attended an event that was catered by Aceituna Grill. The food was incredible, and since everything was catered I was privileged enough to sample most things, deconstructed Greek salad, humus, pita, falafel, shawarma, chicken kabobs, baklava, steak, etc. Everything was great, but even better than the food was the service, Gina one of the owners was there serving food herself. She was so friendly and nice. I told her if I'm ever in the area for work I'll check it out for lunch

Name: Uptowne Mediterranean Restaurant; Review: I found out Uptowne Mediterranean Restaurant by accident. I was shopping in the plaza where it's located and it was lunch time so I wanted to give it a shot. They have great food for really great prices. The chicken and meat shawerma is as fresh as it can be. They cut it off the big rotating skewer and make your meal. The kebabs, appetizers, salads and fixing all are authentic Mediterranean recipes. Lots of Vegetarian choices as well. Falafel, Spinach pie etc. It's a family run business and everyone helping each other and the customers. I started also using them to cater for our company lunches. They make big platters also can make sandwiches. It's the best thing I discovered which reminds me of home. Thanks for your time reading this review

Name: Dates and Olives; Review: Welcoming and friendly chef-proprietor with a charming, positive attitude and an interesting, adventurous, international as well as cross-country life and career story to tell. Delicious and beautiful Mediterranean food. Authentic, well-varied dishes, thoughtfully crafted, with distinctive, inventive ingredients and combinations. Very healthy and vegetarian-friendly, too, though also with plenty of meat available. The restaurant is good to sit down in small groups or for takeout, and it has a burrito-bar setup that allows for easy customization.  Well-priced for those with modest budgets, though slightly out of reach for people with very limited incomes. Maybe the owner could add more low-priced sides or samples of their excellent food to cater to every income level, as well as those just looking for a snack. While keeping median price points high enough to stay profitable and in business. Still, without question a great success, full of delicious, authentically Mediterranean, and healthy options, one well-worth visiting

Name: Zest Mediterranean Grille; Review: I've tried three different schwarma restaurants in Boston and Zest is the best. I had the beef schwarma roll up. I was impressed because all the food looks and tastes very fresh. Even more surprising are the generous portions at such a low price. The gentleman working was very polite and professional, he was happy to tell me my options when I asked. I will definitely be back to try the chicken

Name: Zest Mediterranean Grille; Review: I’m very glad I found this place on boylston st,Very delicious Mediterranean food it reminds me of back home, the price was very cheap for quantity and quality of the food excellent  service and staff was very friendly they even welcomed me with a free falafel dipped in hummus to try tasted very good.would recommend this restaurant because I’ll definitely be back for more","Name: Pita Thyme; Review: I visit Pita Thyme for lunch at least twice a week. They have amazing Mediterranean food. There are several options downtown for Mediterranean food, but I have to say this is definitely the best. Not only is the food rich and flavorful, but they are super quick. They are the perfect pit-stop for lunch downtown.They are reasonably priced (about $8) for the amount of food you get. And if you've ever cooked Mediterranean food, you know that a lot of prep time is required in making this food delicious. Well worth the $8.50 I spend

Name: Olivio's Grille & Pizzeria; Review: Ordered food online 12.27.17/prompt delivery. We had a taste for the Seafood Combo w/ Fresh Shrimp & Scallops - Fresh Haddock as in Fish & Chips/Excellent choice))). It was cooked to perfection/Simply Delicious. (((Highly Recommend))) Thanks Olivio's Grille & Pizzeria..

Name: KAVA neo-taverna; Review: Well thought-out and constructed food, decent and interesting wine selections. Our favorite was the lamb meatballs in tzatziki: delicious grilled flavor on rich tzatziki. My partner really liked the feta in phyllo & honey. We both liked the eggplant in tomato, onion, garlic and cheese although it'd be improved by grilling or smoking the eggplant a bit imho. We both would eagerly reorder the horiatiki salad (tomato, feta, cucumber, etc) which was well balanced and perfectly dressed. We would not order the lemon potatoes again which were not the right type of potatoes and didn't have enough fat to balance the lemon which tasted more like a post cooking dressing.  The outdoor seating is perfect. The service was very good. The white Crete wine was good enough that we sought out and bought a bottle at the wine shop the next day. (The red Crete wine otoh wasn't worthwhile."
Chinese dim sum places,"Name: Winsor Dim Sum Café; Review: My boyfriend and I were passing through Chinatown one late Sunday morning. We were actually on our way to a breakfast sammie spot, but then decided last minute to have dim sum instead, since we were in the area anyway. A quick Yelp search showed me Winsor Dim Sum Cafe and it was only a block away from where we were at, so that's how we decided on that place.  As soon as we arrived, I realized that I had been to this spot 5 years earlier and remember thinking it was only okay. 5 years later, my opinion has not changed. Maybe I'm just used to NYC dim sum, but whenever I have dim sum outside of NYC, it just doesn't taste quite as good. Winsor will do it if you're in a bind and can't find any other dim sum place, but I'm sure Boston has got to have at least one better one out there.  One thing I couldn't decide if I liked or not was their paper system of ordering, as opposed to them pushing the carts around. On one hand, the paper is very efficient - you just mark down the quantities of all of the items that you want. On the other hand, you won't know what the dim sum looks like until it actually comes out.  So now, I'm writing this review so that if I go back to Boston in another 5 years, I'll know to look for a different dim sum joint
Name: China Pearl Restaurant; Review: *This review only pertains to my experiences with their Dim Sum menu*  While not my preferred place to go for Dim Sum, this place is growing on me. Their pork buns are delicious and are, perhaps, the perfect size. Not too big but not to small either. The rice dish that is tucked within a lotus leaf is also quite good, though China Pearl's features some king of meat within it, something I found odd since I always thought this was a vegetarian dish. A friend who has grown up on Dim Sum and acted as my group's culinary navigator confirmed that it doesn't usually have meat inside but can on occasion. Other things that my group of six ordered: shrimp dumplings, those long, flat noodles, sticky rice, pork dumplings (you can tell I'm a Dim sum expert), and those delicious sesame balls for dessert. They do have a buffet bar with other things but I've never ventured over there so I cannot stay what they have/don't have.  I will say that this place can be super crowded, especially if you are thinking about visiting on the weekend. Plan ahead; you might have to wait up to a half hour to be seated, though those tables do turner over fast. Also, waiters can be hit or miss. Same for the carts. You could be waiting fifteen minutes for the right cart to come by only to have it run out of food (again) before it reaches your table.  Despite the cons, this place is great, especially if you are new to Dim Sum or introducing it to your friends. One final thing: don't come here if you are a vegetarian. One of my friends is and she could only eat maybe two dishes, both of which our Dim Sum navigator had to find for her. If you love meat though, come on by
Name: Hei La Moon Restaurant; Review: My review and overall score for Hei La Moon is based on the last two occasions that I was here.  My first visit was because of a Traditional Chinese Wedding Banquet and my second being a Dim Sum visit.  I came here for a Chinese Dinner Wedding Banquet, with about one-hundred guests in attendance.  The blessed event served 10 both very beautifully and delicious dishes, each one having an amazing presentation and it’s on unique flavor to in honor to this celebration.   I have been to many of these banquets, especially recently with all my friends getting married, and they are all good, however, something you notice when attending banquets with a large amount of guests is that by the time one of the dishes come out, it is cooled because it takes so long for the back of the kitchen to plate all the dishes for all the tables.  However, this was not the case for this banquet.  Hei La Moon executed this very well, where the dishes came out very timely to all the tables, making it so the dishes were hot.  Because of the great experience that I had with the banquet, I came back here for Dim Sum with visiting friends from out of town.  This too was done very well.  We came on Saturday, and had to wait 30 minutes for a seat.  FYI for those who are not familiar with Chinese Dim Sum and weekends in China Town, it’s very busy, so expect to wait a bit and also be prepared to share a table with complete strangers.  However, the wait and sharing the table with another group of customers is so worth the food and the experience of having Dim Sum.  It was actually because we were sharing the table with a group of strangers, that my friends from out of town saw some things that they were interested trying and ended up liking very much.  The Dim Sum dishes here are very good, there are a lot of options and the carts being pushed by the staff are moving around very quickly, making it so you can get your items quickly.  If there is something you want and had not seen yet, you can flag down one of the staff with the vest, and let them know what it is you are looking for, and they will bring it to your table.  I have yet come here for dinner, but if the Dim Sum and Chinese Banquet is any indication of their work, I can only imagine that it is just as good
Name: Winsor Dim Sum Café; Review: Just to explain, I'm Chinese-American so my Chinese is very severely limited. So, my mom and I made it a habit to have this as the go-to for dim sum, I insisted she always be with me because she knows Chinese tons better than I do. And I'll say, this place is great for the food, location, cheap prices, and dim sum served all day.  However, I decided to be brave and went 2x on my own. BIG mistake. First time, I asked repeatedly and loud, for a FORK to multiple staff (there's only a handful there, same ones every day) because my chopsticks skills are less than stellar. I was IGNORED. Thankfully I didn't end up flinging any food at other diners at the table! Second time, I asked for WATER, and again, I asked repeatedly and loud to different staff, and was IGNORED. (Note that I did get water the 1st time when I asked). The staff are not idiots, and they do know enough English to understand 'fork' and 'water'. So they just flat out ignore me and my English speaking ways.  So, if you're Asian/Chinese and too 'American' or don't speak Chinese, then you'll likely get mistreated like I did. Doesn't matter if they're busy or not. Only go there if you speak Chinese or have someone with you that does! When my mom was with me, we got tons better treatment. I always got my fork and drink just fine. I go alone and only speak English, and I get NOTHING I asked for.. So no more Winsor Dim Sum Cafe for me
Name: Great Taste Bakery & Restaurant; Review: Service: Do not come here if you are a local. They will not prioritize your order or give you more tea. We had to wait 20-25 minutes for each dish to come out. Traditional dim sum typically have all of the food ready as soon as you order. This dim sum restaurant is a typical ""order and wait for your food to come"". However, the food came out 2 at a time. The staff were arguing with each other constantly. The way they line up their guests, its breaking COVID standards. Though you sit ""6 feet apart"", customers who are walking in will stand next to you. What was ironic was how we even saw customers come after us and RECEIVE THEIR FOOD FASTER than we did. We felt extremely ignored. I support local businesses, but that does not mean that I should accept this quality of service.  Food: Food was mediocre. Does not draw a comparison to good dim sum places that I've been to previously. The tea was great. I felt that because the service was extremely bad, it ruined the food quality with how slow food was coming out and how we did not get a refill of tea.  TLDR: I looked forward to coming here when I was planning to visit Boston for so long. Finally coming here was not up to my expectations. Service standards are a joke","Name: Winsor Dim Sum Café; Review: My boyfriend and I were passing through Chinatown one late Sunday morning.

Name: China Pearl Restaurant; Review: Best dim sum in Boston! We got a table for two with no wait at 10:30am on a Sunday! We usually go earlier in order to miss the crowds, but we got lucky. We're regulars, but our visit last weekend was worthy of a review. A fine selection with the friendly service I've had there to date! Buns, dumplings, rices, delicious fried things...it was all so good. A new feature since our last visit: pour guards on the teapots. It's SO much safer. Before, even an experienced tea drinker/dim sum goer could expect to spill a few cups on the table, but no more! We didn't spill a drop and it was super easy to refill our cups throughout the meal. As always, the atmosphere and decor are fine--nothing overly special, but not shabby. We also took quite a bit home with us for lunch and the rest of the family. We usually eat ourselves silly and spend about $60 for four people and we kept that rate this weekend
Name: Double Chin Modern Asian Restaurant; Review: This is by far the best restaurant in Chinatown, and maybe even all of Boston. Let's start with the food. Double Chin has some very creative HK/Asian fusion dishes and there's something for everyone - whether you're trying to pig out at 3am (see: cube toast) or grab a healthy yet delectable lunch (see: the tofu chinwich). I went here with friends one night, and we proceeded to eat the most food we've ever eaten in one sitting. We asked our servers if there was some type of reward included for doing so, but they laughed and told us no - all you get to leave with is a double chin. The food is just bonkers good. The bakery connected to Double Chin, Bao Bao Bakery, also has some great baked goods and bubble teas. Next up is the vibe. Trying to get tipsy before a night out at Royale? This is the spot to pop off....they have Soju in fish tanks and fish bowls :0. The place will be buzzing on a typical weekend night, and there are board games available! The interior is unlike any other place in Chinatown (i.e., it's not dull, boring and smelly), and the menu is so colorful and filled with puns you'll be tempted to ask your server if you can take a menu to go. Next up is pricing. Five words: VERY reasonable and GENEROUS portions. Lastly is the staff/service. Everyone I've interacted with has been friendly and attentive, so no issues here. I've even met the two sisters who own the place, and now I understand the genius behind Double Chin. The creative mindscape of the owners is clearly some form of unprecedented wizardry. 10/10 all around. I'll definitely be eating here for years to come :
Name: Chau Chow City; Review: Food: dim sum was very good. We ordered some dim sum and they cooked for us, just with some wait. Prices are very reasonable.  The restaurant looks old, like the typical Chinatown type. This may turn off some people. Some may not care.  The wait staff were nice. I figure it was not very busy and they could be more attentative.  Overall, it serves real Chinese dim sum.

Name: Gourmet Dumpling House; Review: Gourmet Dumpling House is one of my favorite restaurants in Chinatown. They are notoriously busy. They're not one of the top restaurants in Boston for nothing. Unfortunately if you dine here as a couple you will be sharing a table with strangers which will be the only unpleasant thing about your dining experience. We came right as they opened their doors so half of the restaurant was empty but they still seated my party of two at a larger table and had us share it with another couple. As long as you only care about the food, it's a solid 5/5.  I first visited this establishment 3 years ago and thought it was good but nothing special. I made my second visit approximately 1 month ago and basically loved everything we ordered. I have a tendency to over-order but with Gourmet having such a large menu, it's hard not to. Their soup dumplings are plump and full of delicious, flavorful soup. The Szechuan wonton with chili oil was a refreshing dish due to the cucumber and carrots that accompanied the wontons. The chili oil is a tasty mixture, however, it is lacking in heat. The wontons were solid. The Sandong style pan fried dumplings with pork & shrimp were good but I would have liked them more if they were even crispier. Each of our dumpling dishes came with their own dipping sauce. You will have to ask for chili sauce because they don't keep any condiments at the table.  The scallion pancakes were perfect! Crispy and delicious. My boyfriend and I are going through a phase where we are obsessed with salt & pepper chicken wings and calamari so we had to order them. Everything was seasoned well and fried to perfection. Both the chicken wings and calamari sit on a bed of iceberg lettuce to add a different texture and balance out the saltiness. I love that the chicken wings were also seasoned with that special Chinese seasoning on top of the salt & pepper that really just enhances the whole dish. We definitely had to get a few to-go boxes but our overall lunch experience was super yummy","Name: Great Barbecue; Review: Great takeout. $12 for half a chicken and $1 for rice. Delicious, simple, and fast. Excellent place to grab a quick bite and super friendly staff. Hidden gem in Chinatown

Name: Gourmet Dumpling House; Review: This place was on our list for a long long time. Now that we have been here, it's off our list - for good. Here is a long and short of it:  - Dumpling options: really disappointing. We always thought the juicy dumplings were a specialty and there would be lots of other options for dim sum. Not the case. And the juicy dumplings themselves - a major let down. Dry from the outside. The juice inside is just vinegar. And the accompanying dip is even more tart and vinegary than the juice inside.  - The rest of the menu is very extensive. So just don't get the hype about dumplings at all (and hence the name of the place is absolutely deceiving)  - We got what seemed to be a good entree, to understand what the huge menu had to offer. The Schezuan seafood dish. Supposed to be a spicy, hot dish. Again - very disappointed. Lack of classic schezuan flavors. No heat of any kind. And where were those red schezuan peppercorns?? We weren't even compelled to ask for the hot chili oil to make the taste better. A half hearted dish just put together - without any personality or flavors.  - And expect to get your check halfway through your meal. So if you decide to try something more, tough luck.  - finally, the space inside is absolutely tiny. Anyone who has been to Taiwan Cafe (mind-blowing food btw) has more space inside than this one.  So the math was pretty straight forward. Tiny space. A lot of hype. After 5:30pm on weekends - hence = long waits on the Main Street. Result - even more hype!!!!!  To those who go here again and again and again and again - good for you all! Please keep doing that. Leave the other places for us. Thank you very much. Which places are better than this one? You think I'm gonna disclose? Nope. Please keep standing in the wait. ""This place is really good"".  PS: Gave 2 and not 1 star because - this place definitely has the potential, to be downgraded from 2 to 1 - if and whenever we do decide to go back

Name: Myers+Chang; Review: Imagine that you don't get into the city that often, and in this case the city in question is Boston. You don't live in the suburbs; you're out beyond the suburbs, in the hinterlands of Southwestern New Hampshire. But it's a special occasion, and your wife is taking you to Boston to celebrate. There's an endless variety of restaurants to choose from, but you recall how much you enjoy Joanne Chang's Flour Bakery, so you make the decision to visit her other establishment that she owns in partnership with her husband. You decide to enjoy Dim Sum at Myers+Chang.  Arriving right on time for our 11:45 am reservation, we were quickly seated at a two-top near the bar that borders two sides of the open kitchen. We're close to the action, but not too close. On a subsequent visit, perhaps we'll request a seat at the bar. The  Dim Sum menu has 34 items to choose from ... and they all look great. Dim Sum is a style of eating Chinese food; where from a menu or a cart, you select small plates to share at your table. The staff at Myers+Chang is amazing, always present when you have a question about anything, friendly, and extremely professional. We feel like we are dining among good friends.  As always when go out for Dim Sum, we order more than we can possibly eat: Thai Chicken Ginger Salad with Vermicelli; two orders of Spring Rolls with Peach Duck Sauce; Hakka Eggplant; Braised Pork Belly Bao; Two orders of Mama Chang's Pork and Chive Potstickers; Nirvana Chicken Congee; Tea Smoked Ribs; and a fried rice dish called Nasi Goreng, with pork, pineapple, and egg.  Each dish arrives at the moment it is ready, one after the other. We split the braised pork belly bao; it's a mouthful of heaven. We were wise to decide on two orders of the spring rolls with duck sauce; they were perfect. The congee, which we've never had before, is beyond expectation. Certainly we'll be looking for Congee recipes to prepare at home, we decide. The potstickers are very good. properly prepared and delicately flavored. I'm no huge fan of eggplant, but the hakka eggplant is delicious. The tea smoked ribs were prepared perfectly, and compared to the smoked ribs I make, had a very different flavor profile that complemented the other dishes on the table. The Nasi Goreng was tasty, and the pineapple in the dish really made it a stand out.  The last dish to the table was Thai chicken ginger salad. It was the only cold dish we ordered, and neither of us were a huge fan. When our waiter asked how we liked the meal, we mentioned it wasn't something we'd order again ... there wasn't a problem with the dish, but it just wasn't to our taste. When the check came, we found that she removed it from the bill, which was appreciated but certainly not necessary. The experience at the restaurant, from start to finish, was great. Nothing fell short or was wanting. This is exactly what you'd look for if you wanted to enjoy the perfect celebratory meal with a few good friends.  Doggy bag in hand, we left full, happy, and very impressed with Myers+Chang ... we were well fortified for the rest of our day's adventure

Name: Pho Hoa; Review: Been here several times before. My go to Pho place in Boston. I used to think this was the best Pho place in Chinatown. However, this last time, the Pho was not as flavorful and they were more skimpy on the meat. Perhaps the place changed hands or cooks or maybe just an off day. But reason enough to try one of the other places next time

Name: Hei La Moon Restaurant; Review: I've been to this place twice, the first one alone to have dinner and the last one with some friends to lunch. When you enter staff will receive you and they will take you to your table. You will soon realize that this place is really huge, and if that's not enough there's another area of the size size downstairs, wow!  The first time I want there were almost no people, maybe because it was too late. The first thing they do is serve you some tea and some water. In my first time I got the menu, no carries overt there, so as they had a comprehensive Dim Sum menu.  I ordered some DimSum and they took some minutes to got them, but they were really good, they didn't look frozen or precooked, they were fresh and very tasty.  Last time I went to have lunch it was really packed, the first floor was almost at full capacity, but we made a reservation, so we didn't have to worry.  This time there were some ladies with the carries and offering some dishes to the customers ( I like it, I prefer to see instead knowing of the ingredients ). We had some DimSum ( yummy!), vegetables like pepper, tofu and eggplant ( I love this Chinese dish ).  The service is not 5-star, but it's enough to have a good meal. A must if you like DimSum and Chinese food"
Sushi conveyor belt restaurants,"Name: YO! Sushi & Izakaya; Review: Quite honestly, the host is the reason I’m giving this place 2 stars instead of 1. The sushi is fine. It’s what you’d expect from $3.59 conveyor belt dishes that are premade and rolling along. It’s especially nice, though, that you’re able to grab your food as it glides past you when your server is nowhere to be found. She did greet me and bring me water and checked on me once before I snagged anything off the belt. You’re instructed to press a button in front of you if you need anything. I waited for her to come back so I could pay for several minutes before the host walked by and asked if I needed anything. He completed the transaction for me and my server came back with the printed check and slammed it in front of me. Average food. Poor service
Name: YO! Sushi & Izakaya; Review: Mediocre sushi and sides whose main appeal is the conveyer belt, but far inferior to any other conveyer belt sushi place I've been to in Asia. The fish was a little limp although overall tasted fine, and the selection of sushi on the belt standard: spicy tuna, shrimp tempura, California roll, etc. The furikake fries were tasty although not accurate to the menu description--it was supposed to have furikake and bonito flakes on it and from the picture you can see there was neither. The rose was also pretty bad, didn't go down smoothly.  Also I think because they're new, a lot of the things we wanted to order weren't available e.g. the sake cocktail, the cauliflower side dish. A bit disappointing overall, cost $44 for two people
Name: YO! Sushi & Izakaya; Review: The food is not bad; it is not interesting or particularly excellent. Y any means, you can find this quality at most chain restaurants that offer sushi on the counter. The quality of the sushi is ... meh? All the pieces were coming apart, they weren't rolled properly. The curry is quite good tho. Dessert? Forget about it, don't even bother.  The service is not great, it feels like the staff wasn't trained and they don't deliver a cohesive experience. In order to place an order with a waiter you have press a button and a light in front of you will light up but it will never turn off again, so if you forget to press the the light off you will see that the waiters will come you multiple times.  The experience overall is alright, you would figure out pretty quickly that there's not much variety on the conveyor belt so you will get tired of seeing the same pretty quickly. The space is bright! And having the main kitchen in the middle is the best part, being able to see how they cook is always a plus. The are also very clean.  I could cope with all the things above if it wasn't so overpriced for what you get here, it really is overpriced and you will most likely leave with a bitter taste... you might feel like you just got tricked

Name: Ginza Japanese; Review: Great place for Boston Sushi","Name: New Sushi Inc; Review: Kind of a build your own Sushi Bowl place. I think Chipotle, but with sushi. Fish was fresh, sauces were delicious, and my order was accurate. I ordered online, and the pickup was seamless. There's not much seating in the restaurant itself, it shares a spot with a defunct Dunkin Donuts and a sub shop. Definitely not a place you'd want to go if you want to sit down and have a meal, but it's excellent if you want a quick little lunch on your break at work. I'm glad I found it! Definitely get the crispy garlic on top
Name: YO! Sushi & Izakaya; Review: Not good.  2nd night they were open.  Waiter couldn't English at all. Had no idea what he was saying. They ran out of the pineapple soda listed as special drink in the menu. Thats fine but the food was terrible.  The yakisoba noodles were overwhelmed by bellpepper but otherwise bland. The chicken teriyaki was like eating salty Legos. The popcorn shrimp were overly breaded and greasy, no flavor.  The sushi going around the belt was poorly made and the fish looked very thin and unfresh. Most of the belt items were deserts or totally lackluster choices like cucumber rolls. When I eat sushi I usually go to town and eat a ton of stuff.... Here I couldn't even stand looking at the choices going by me on the belt.  The one highlight was the green tea was strong hot and tastey. Otherwise this place needs to step it up or list that conveyor belt on eBay today to recoup their losses
Name: Basho Sushi; Review: Quick. Convenient. Make your sushi and bowl. Carry away
Name: New Sushi Inc; Review: The layout of this place is both hilarious and puzzling as it is connected directly to a Dunkin Donuts. When a colleague brought me along for a lunch, I was certainly very puzzled. The sushi burritos are far and away one of the best sushi burritos I've had in Boston. I got the premade Rainbow burrito (tuna and salmon) but you can also make your own creations. The price was great for the quality of the sushi and ingredients, and the pricing wasn't too steep, all things considered. Do yourself a favor and try this place, although I would't recommend pairing it with an iced coffee

French patisseries in town,"Name: Olivia's Pizza; Review: The pizza is excellent I am new in town and. I haven't try everything but what I had I love i
Name: Caffè dello Sport; Review: It happens very frequently that the ""Little Italy"" neighborhoods in the United States have now lost any character of authenticity and are very often groupings of restaurants, cafes and patisseries that generally recall Italy in the name of the place without having any Italian specificity (The language , products sold, etc.). This is NOT the case of Café dello Sport where I found an authentic Italian coffee, where the TV was broadcasting a soccer match in the Italian league and where there were many Italians and tourists. I liked it and would go back.
Name: Grand Tour; Review: We were excited to try this new place but it was unfortunately very disappointing. I’m French and have lived most of my life in France and the food at Grand Tour is not even close to French food sadly... First, it is incredibly overpriced. To give a few examples, the Jambon de Paris was 3-4 slices of thin ham (not Parisian ham at all by the way) at $10. The cheese plate was a selection of 3 New England cheeses (not even French ones) and the 3 pieces were paper thin at $24. We also had the Foie Gras which was tasteless at $22. Tip is also included at 20% for a party of any size (we were just 2 people) which we thought was unusual for Boston. The service was good though. Overall, not a French experience at all. Just a pretentious overpriced restaurant...it was deeply disappointing
Name: Frenchie Wine Bistro; Review: To kick off our dinner, we shared some « escargots », some « coq au vin », and what I consider to be the best Tuna Tartare in town. Everything was so good that we asked for extra bread to finish all the sauce, but please don’t repeat that... But it wasn’t until the traditional « steak frites » cooked medium rare and the home made french fries, which is such a typical french meal, and which was soooo good, that I trully felt like in one of the best French brasserie in Paris. And I’m not done yet... I won’t even get started with the wine and cheese list, because I could write 2000 words only about it and how I almost had tears of joy because of it, but I’d say this: The olive oil cake we had as a dessert is simply the best dessert I had in a very long time, and makes it worth it by itself to put Frenchie on top of your to-dos when you come to Boston. LOVED IT
Name: Bar Lyon; Review: Overall this restaurant had outstanding French comfort food.I had the burger which was probably one of the best burgers I've had in the last 5 years I normally don't get a burger for dinner but I figured I'd give it a shot and it was boy it was good! Prices were not really cheap it was a moderately priced restaurant. Definitely was hopping when we were there.we plan to go there again soon not sure exactly what I mean it's a fair distance from where we live but it's worth the drive. If you do like true French cuisine I would highly recommend the cassoulet. Overall there's nothing on the restaurant menu that I actually could not recommend. We're big when it comes to French food and I would say everything on there was a winner","Name: Tatte Bakery & Cafe; Review: The one located on Charles Street was directly on the way to the conference I was attending, so I started to go to this location on the way to work.  It is much smaller than the one at Back Bay, but cozy and welcoming. The decoration as well as their menu offering is about the same, so you could still get the same good delights from here. The seating is quite limited, just a handful of tables and a few counter seating by the entrance/exit. But, they do have a lovely outdoor seating, although not large, but with nice greenery and a few enthusiastic little birds.  On a first day, I got a few baked goods to go. I ordered an Almond Croissant which was large, fluffy, sweet, flaky, everything I wanted it to be. I also got something called Chocolate Rose. it was good, tasty, not too chocolate-y but still got the chocolate flavor that I wanted.  On the second day, I had my breakfast right there at their outdoor seating. I got Iced Mocha, strong with very noticeable mocha flavor. For food, I ordered Ricotta & Jam Tartine. These were HUGE pieces of bread, much bigger than I expected them to be…  It was rich, creamy, fresh and tart, each bite was heavenly. It was so filling that after having a half of one, I was getting really full. Giving this much of high quality, delicious breakfast item for below $10 is so crazy, it should be a crime!  So, there you have it. This location is also a pretty darn good spot for a quick or relaxing breakfast
Name: Le Foyer Bakery; Review: This place is a staple in the Haitian community in Boston They serve pastries and baked goods from haitian culture. the patties are most likely the best seller here (known to run out) also the loafs of bread are quite popular.  the prices are fair. the beef patties are practically meatless which is one the reasons I rated it 4 instead of 5 stars. also they will trash talk you in creole if they think you don't understand the language.  (but I go for pastries not to make friends.
Name: Cafe Madeleine; Review: Where do I even start with cafe Madeleine. Everything is so good and so fresh.  I like to go everywhere to try chocolate eclairs. But for Boston they have the best chocolate eclair and just like everything else it’s made in extremely small batches and they sell out instantly.  I used to think they have the best almond croissant as well until I ended up trying the Chocolate almond croissant. I’m in Heaven thinking about it.  And the lightest ham and cheese- just perfect for a picnic.  I normally pick up an eclair and ham cheese to go eat at the park.  I never buy too much of everything cause I love how fresh it is when eaten day of🥰 thank you guys for doing such a great job
Name: Panificio Bistro & Bakery; Review: We had walked up Charles Street, stopping at whatever antique shops were still open, all the way to Boston Commons and back again, stopping at Beacon Hill Chocolates for a bit of flavor. Now we were getting hungry, and we needed to sit down somewhere. Panificio’s was perfect. I got a little pizza, which was the perfect size and shape (just almost not quite round), and being on foot and not in car, I got a beer. Fantastic! The waitress was efficient and timely, the decor was tasteful (even the posters in the bathroom displayed a bit of panache). I recommend this restaurant highly
Name: Tatte Bakery & Cafe; Review: This place looks beautiful, and all the pastries delicious.  I got the $4 Chocolate Hazelnut Twist. It looks a picture but I have to take a star off, because doesn't really taste it- the hazelnut is there, but not the chocolate. It tastes more like the end of a batch of cinnamon rolls that got skimped on the filling. Mostly dense pastry to the point it's unpleasant.  I'll still be back to try more. From what I've heard of their other locations, this seems like just a fluke, and not what to expect from their quality.  -  Came back to try more! I tried out their online ordering this time. I ordered two Ham and Cheese Croissants. When I got there around 20 minutes after I ordered (website said it'd be ready in ~15), I didn't find my order on the pick-up shelf. I waited another 5 minutes or so, and watched the staff serve people walk-in pastries, but didn't seem to be aware of my order.  I walked over to the counter to find what I had ordered, and one of the staff helped me. They only had one of the ham and cheese left- he said they must've just ran out when I placed the order. That was disappointing, but he offered to replace it with anything of equal value.  The ham and cheese was delicious, so I can see why it sold out, but at $4.50 each they should have a better system to be sure you are getting what you ordered","Name: Bistro du Midi; Review: Easter weekend and I'm just gnoming around..  And...  Happened upon this place..  This super duper cool resturant and you know this gnomb likes French Bistro's! This particular bistro looked super inviting so I reserved a table for Sunday Brunch Easter Sunday. Pre-set menu?  Outstanding!! Did the service and taste live up to the print? Yes it did. Five stars and top notch service, food, plates, decor, menu and coat check. They even let me vape inside!!! Just kidding. That didn't really happen but I have to say that it was almost like vaping because... For dessert they had my favorite dessert of all time on the menu! Something that only a French Bistro can do right and let me tell ya, this gnome knows French so well... Well you get the picture.. Beignets Beignets and more Beignets please keep the Biegnets coming with extra drizzle,  extra custard and extra C R E A M. I added that C R E A M in there for my Vaper followers who know exactly what I'm talking about and like to dine where I dine #flabom 👍 Nice work Cafe du Midi. This Gnomb may roam but he'll swing back for another 😎😙💨💨

Name: Bar Boulud; Review: Came in for a late lunch on a Saturday to the new Bar Boulud located inside the Mandarin Oriental. First, the location is gorgeous. It has a french winery/bistro feel as some of the walls are covered with what looks like wine cases, nice concept.  I should start with my biggest disappointment though, in what really should have been a highlight, the service... After a great welcome by the manager we sat down and were eventually greeted by our waiter. The only time we saw our waiter from that point on was to take our order and to get the check and offer dessert. When plates were taken after the appetizers we were left without silverware for about 5 minutes into our entree. We were also left without beverages for extended periods of time. This is the kind of restaurant where your glass of water (or any glass) should never be empty. Normally it would warrant a 3 star review but since they've only been open for a week I'm giving them a bit of a pass, but for this caliber of restaurant the service was unacceptable.  The food on the other hand ranged from good to excellent and I would return to try other items I didn't try on my first visit. Here is what I tried:  Rillions - if you've had Latin food before you may have had chicharrón's and these are very similar. These were far superior to any Latin version of the dish I have had before. These fried pieces of pork belly were perfectly crispy on the outside while being juicy on the inside. Perfectly executed and cam with some Dijon mustard that had hints of horseradish.  Shrimps Al Ajillio - Shrimp in a garlic cream sauce. It's as delicious as it sounds. The shrimps tasted fresh and the sauce was perfect for dipping the complimentary fresh sourdough bread they provided. This dish also had a great presentation, I like when food looks like art.  Super Green Spinach - it was super and it was very green. Great side dish, even for someone like me who steers clear of veggies generally. The French know what they are doing.  Croque Madame - House made ham, melted Gruyere cheese on toasted white bread with a béchamel sauce. Topped with a farm fresh egg. This dish was not only heavenly and rich but the presentation was gorgeous. For those not familiar with french cuisine I would compare it to a lunch croissant in terms of its flavor profile.  Frenchie Burger - topped with tomato mustard and confit pork belly, which I found to be more or less similar to bacon. It came with a side of fries and was cooked perfectly. The burger, like all the other dishes, had a great presentation. While the burger was perfectly good, I've had better in this price range.  Macaroons & Chocolates - Small dessert plate for about $6 that has 2 small pieces of chocolate and 2 mini macaroons. A good ending for someone with a sweet tooth who may be starting to get full

Name: Cafe Bonjour; Review: I was excited to check out the newly-opened Cafe Bonjour. Located in a former sewing machine showroom at Temple Place, it is steps from southbound Orange Line trains. The space is cozy, with French subway tile softened by an abundance of historical wood paneling.  The menu is well-designed and the staff kind and accommodating. The cafe manages to comfortably walk the line between classics like croque monsieur, and diet-conscious options. Items are clearly labeled gluten-free, vegetarian. They offer ethically sourced ingredients and plant-based options. Think Gaslight-Tatte-BeGood-Mother Juice mashup.  Of course, you want to know about the food. My charming dining partner had the Mediterranean crepe with spinach and chicken and declared it ""the best thing ever!"" The bit that I sampled confirmed this--it was balanced and satisfyingly savory. I ordered the Montecristo, which was a crepe with goat cheese and ham, generously topped with honey and almonds. It's a tasty and unique option for people who want a treat that is both sweet and salty. After sampling the Mediterranean, though, I had a hankering for some veg on my plate and the staff very kindly whipped up a garden salad side for me.  Add to these items a beautifully made cortado and a perfectly sweetened latte, and our brunchy lunch was complete. Cafe Bonjour is just the sort of lovely place to bring visiting friends--or to get away from the city for a few minutes. A new favorite in the heart of Boston

Name: Petit Robert Bistro; Review: I came here on a date after I mentioned that I had never really had quality French food before. My date made a reservation and it wasn't too busy for 6:30pm on a Thursday night, but we were seated right away. We had the option to sit outside or inside, and we chose to sit outside since it was a nice day and the neighborhood seemed quiet. We ordered the escargots and half a dozen oysters to start, and they were both absolutely delicious. The escargots were flavorful, and the oysters were extremely refreshing. For our entrees, I ordered the scallops and my date ordered the pork. The pork looked like it was breaded, which surprised my date, since he was here last year and it was prepared differently then. It was still tasty, but maybe a tad overcooked. The scallops were cooked perfectly though so I had no complaints! I took off one star for the service since it wasn't the quickest. Overall, I wouldn't mind coming back

Name: Frenchie Wine Bistro; Review: Cozy, intimate and warm environment - perfect for lingering over a delicious meal with friends. I haven’t had a meal like this in ages. Frenchie is exactly what a neighborhood bistro should be. We started with cocktails (the frose was perfect) then moved on to wine - you can get a glass of most wines on the menu so we tried three! The escargot toast and foie gras were our favorite appetizers, and the branzino was incredible - salt crusted whole fish, deboned and prepped at the table. I thought I was full but then the desert came. The olive oil cake was beautifully moist and the creme brûlée perfection. Honestly an overall incredible meal in such a beautiful, comfortable space that made French dining feel like a local meal with friends","Name: Cafe Madeleine; Review: I was and am looking for bakery products like croissants and bread, Baguettes, pastries, cheese like Gruyere and cold cuts products like salami and prosciutto in the USA similar to those I had living in Europe, Switzerland and I found it in this cute little bakery, Cafe Madeleine. Deliciouse Croissants and the bread, Baguette I will try tomorrow and I am sure it will be as good as I had them in Europe. There is only one other bakery in New York, where I had an excellent almond Croissant, just ""finger licking good"".👌🥖🥐🧀 Thank you cafe Madeleine

Name: Cafe Vanille; Review: Wish this place was better because it's cute and in a great location. I have been here a couple of times and everything I have had isn't that great. The pastries I have had isn't that fresh and mediocre coffee at best. My advice is skip it. There is much better in Boston

Korean hot pot spots,"Name: Korean Garden; Review: Came back here to eat the octopus hot pot with mt daughter tonight. The service and food was delicious and was thinking to tip more than 20% no matter what my bill is, but until the last GIRL(WAITRESS) who helped us packed my fold to go. Im not aure if ahe is new but her attitude was very mad and does not know how to smile and never ever once said thank you. And she almost burn me when she was packing ny hot pot food in a container for me. And doesnt even bother to said sorrg when she saw my rubbing my hand. At least ask if its her the one who hurt my hand when she saw my rubbing my hand. Bad and want you guys to train that girl&& place is always my favorite korean resturant to go to. I always tell people about you guys. Comes  here whenever i get a chance or crave for korean food and nowhere else. So ended up didnt tip them as much as i wanted to because of her
Name: Suishaya; Review: Friends of mine took me once to this place, with Korean and Japanese styles dishes, inside Chinatown hood.  If you look for a fork, knife or spoon, don't look for them, it's supposed to use your provided chopsticks and in case you order something that it's mandary in order to help eating it, they will be provided.  This was my first Korean restaurant in the US, so I declined their Sushi section in the menu and I headed to the Korean dishes.  First of all, you'll get some apetizers as red beans, bean spouts, carrot with chilli.  First time I tried Okdol Bibimbap, it came in a really hot pan, with all the ingredients ready to be cooked in it and a small recipient with spicy sauce. You have to be fast and start mixing it to don't get your food burnt. I ordered it with spicy pork, so it was spicy and very hot, it took me more than half hour to finish it, the amount of food also was big tho. My experience was food, the food, service and the local were good.  The second time I had Jam Bang with Korean noodle, also a big bowl came to the table, with the usual thick Korean noddles, mussels, shrimps and a selection of vegetables. As it was raining it was the perfect choice, it was both hot and spicy. The noodles and the soup were tasty and flavourful, I usually don't eat soup but this one it was really worth it.  As I came with some friends both times I tried Bulgogi Beef, that was pretty good.  The only bad things is they don't have beer nor home made tea, so don't expect anything good for drink.  The second time the fire alarm was triggered as some dishes are really hot and smoke comes out of them, but it's a mere anecdote
Name: Kaju Korean Cuisine — Kenmore; Review: Came here for dinner. Pretty straight forward decor inside. No wait on a weekend dinner time. I tried the clay pot bulgogi. Which was a bunch of meat and rice underneath. It tasted ok nothing amazing. I added a lot of their hot sauce to bring some flavor and it was better. My friend tried the tofu soup. They asked for it extra spicy and it felt like medium spicy if you are into spicy food. Tasted like regular tofu soup too. Overall it was average Korean food. Would try if you are in area and looking for Korean but I'm sure better elsewher
Name: Happy Lamb Hot Pot; Review: Best hot pot around and the broth is SOOOO delicious. I come here with my family once a week. I used to go to Shabuzen all the time but the broth just does not compare. Also, it’s WAY cheaper! Obviously, more expensive compared to making hot pot at home but I don’t think the price gap is that drastic. I definitely recommend coming here
Name: SOJUba; Review: I heard a Korean restaurant opened near my school so my friends and I went to try it over the weekend. The place is really nice, and quite big for a Korean restaurant. We were fourth in line on the waiting list, and the host took us to the bar area right away to get our night started. The bar area is just as chill, so we told ourselves that we would just eat at the bar if tables didn’t open up in the next 30 min. 25 minutes or so, a table opened up downstairs, and we ordered pretty much everything on the menu. Their original chicken was to die for, and the boodae pot was really really good too. It had a lively vibe with people enjoying themselves everywhere around me. We didn’t mean to go out drinking, but the scene def called for it! Four bottles of soju in, we asked for requests to the DJ and stayed until closing. The servers are super fun and friendly, and the owner came to check on us in the middle of our meal. This is a new gem for me and my friends for sure! I’m glad we don’t need to hike to Allston now to enjoy soju with authentic Korean food","Name: Tasty Pot; Review: My friends and I were originally trying to go to Happy Lamb Hot Pot in Central Square, but the wait was 1.5 hours, so we quickly Yelped for other good hot pot places without a wait. Tasty Pot was taking reservations on Yelp, and the wait seemed a lot shorter, so we drove over. Our table was ready while we were on the way, so by the time we got there, it was like 20 minutes past when we had gotten the call that our table was ready. There was a line and I thought that they'd make us wait, but they seated us right away without any problems.  We didn't know until we got there that Tasty Pot is Taiwanese style, meaning everyone gets their own individual pot with a bunch of ingredients. There are about a dozen pre-set options with various ingredients, and you can adjust the spice level. I got the ma la beef, which was a bit pricey at $22, but I was very happy with the amount and quality of the food. It was truly spicy though - the edges of my mouth were red and raw by the time I was done!  Would recommend this restaurant
Name: Tasty Pot; Review: Came here on a Friday night around 6:30pm and we added our names to the waitlist. We were seated pretty soon, which was good, as there's not really an area to wait in and we felt kind of in the way (there are shops in the area to walk around when you wait instead). I had the Taiwanese Supreme Spicy Pot (very spicy level) and it was the perfect amount of spice. I really liked the combo of meat, seafood, and veggies in the flavorful broth. At first, it doesn't look like a lot of food, but it's deep, you get rice or vermicelli with it, and it definitely is very filling! I also liked the dipping sauces that you could mix together at the table. I'd like to go back to try the bubble teas as well or some other hot pots, but overall, really good experience
Name: Tasty Pot; Review: This hotspot place is newly open in the area. Went to Boston to visit my cousin who recently moved to the area. It was freezing cold like winter last few days and we were craving something hot and spicy. We want to do hot pot at home, but we're too lazy to do all the purchase and preparation. We searched on yelp and notice this newly open hotpot restaurant just few blocks away. I'm so glad we gave it a try. They are fabulous, variety of food choices and they even have a tofu choice. Cause I'm trying to cooperate more vegetables into my diet and my new favorite food is tofu. And this tofu blends perfectly with the broth. It also came with a bowl of rice but we still order a side of noodle cause I loved noodles. Overall, it was a great experience and I clean the bowl, yes everything in the bowl was clear including the broth
Name: Liuyishou Hotpot; Review: Fun time! Came on a Monday winter evening for a Yelp Elite 2020 event and it was super fun. They really pulled out all the stops for the Yelp Elite crowd, with carved watermelons and radishes done up like peacocks, tressed-up tripe and intestines, lots of really beautiful beef and lamb with marbling as fine as anything in Italy, and excellent noodles in crazy flavors like dragonfruit and spinach. The broths at Liuyishou are second to none, so good that I didn't even hit the (admittedly alluring) sauce bar. The angus steak was amazing: 15s and you get this melt-in-your-mouth beef taste that is coated in the excellent fatty broth. The wagyu beef cubes were also good but easy to lose in the broth and overcook. The shrimp paste was my favorite seafood item (I found the scallops hard to time appropriately and the oysters a little strange), and the house-made balls were super tasty and fun--they had a cheese-filled beef ball! (Or at least I think it was cheese...?) I found the noodles nice and ""kiu"" (great mouthfeel) although the flavor wasn't very strong. The color was more for appeal than taste, imho.  Fresh watermelon juice and cold jelly with sesame, brown sugar, peanuts, and haw flakes rounded out a spicy, steamy evening and cooled it down. Excellent service, incredibly high quality ingredients, and a really fun hot pot experience. I've heard Liuyishou has a pretty long wait and is pricier for hot pot but if they have this level of quality for ingredients every night, then it's probably worth it
Name: Kaze Shabu Shabu; Review: Nice hotpot, or shabu shabu, spot right on the edge of the busy streets of Chinatown.  Restaurant is very clean and has very spacious seating (particularly when you compare it to the typical crammed seating of any restaurant on Beach st).  Certainly kid-friendly as they had clean high chairs readily available and the waitress was very attentive.  Food-wise, it was filling, tasty, and at a great price point for their lunch specials.  The meats were ok, but the broths definitely made up for it.  We tried the tomyum and tonkotsu.  Both very delicious and flavorful.  If you're in the market to try out a different hotpot restaurant that is a few steps away from the hectic crowds, then give this one a try","Name: Tasty Pot; Review: My friends and I were originally trying to go to Happy Lamb Hot Pot in Central Square, but the wait was 1.5 hours, so we quickly Yelped for other good hot pot places without a wait.

Name: Suishaya; Review: Friends of mine took me once to this place, with Korean and Japanese styles dishes, inside Chinatown hood.  If you look for a fork, knife or spoon, don't look for them, it's supposed to use your provided chopsticks and in case you order something that it's mandary in order to help eating it, they will be provided.  This was my first Korean restaurant in the US, so I declined their Sushi section in the menu and I headed to the Korean dishes.  First of all, you'll get some apetizers as red beans, bean spouts, carrot with chilli.  First time I tried Okdol Bibimbap, it came in a really hot pan, with all the ingredients ready to be cooked in it and a small recipient with spicy sauce. You have to be fast and start mixing it to don't get your food burnt. I ordered it with spicy pork, so it was spicy and very hot, it took me more than half hour to finish it, the amount of food also was big tho. My experience was food, the food, service and the local were good.  The second time I had Jam Bang with Korean noodle, also a big bowl came to the table, with the usual thick Korean noddles, mussels, shrimps and a selection of vegetables. As it was raining it was the perfect choice, it was both hot and spicy. The noodles and the soup were tasty and flavourful, I usually don't eat soup but this one it was really worth it.  As I came with some friends both times I tried Bulgogi Beef, that was pretty good.  The only bad things is they don't have beer nor home made tea, so don't expect anything good for drink.  The second time the fire alarm was triggered as some dishes are really hot and smoke comes out of them, but it's a mere anecdote","Name: Joy Luck Hot Pot; Review: The service is excellent and fast:  I don't even have to see the menu, they remember my preferences and every single detail. Unlike other restaurants, the wait persons are very fast in responding. The food is fresh and healthy. The price is reasonable but the portion is big with a good variety of vegetables in the Hotpot combo. The place is spacious, quiet, and bright. You'll also have Classical Chinese music in the background. Not too loud like other Chinese restaurants. They also have big round table to do group hot pots. If you like hot pot, this place is one of the best in town

Name: Coreanos Allston; Review: Ate here for dinner! It's a small space with not many areas for sitting. With it being a mexican/korean fusion place there are some interesting choices on the menu! Took awhile to get our food because we didn't even know it was ready. It'd be nice if the waitress called out the order or if they had a better system to allow the customer to realize their food is ready to go. I ordered the coreanos bowl and the kimchi fries. The coreanos bowl was pretty delicious. A little greasy but it has a nice spicy flavor. The egg they put on top was perfect. The kimchi fries were alright. Maybe its because it had been sitting for awhile but the potato was kind of dry and greasy, but the kimchi and sauce was good. Overall it's an alright place! I'd go back to try their other options

Name: Seoul Jangteo; Review: Been on my bucket list for about a month now and finally paid a visit! Cute little place, very friendly staff and a good range of items on the menu, also very reasonably priced. We ordered the fritters and bibimbap. I believe the most popular item there was their soup but since I already had my eye on the spicy black bean noodles with pork, I decided to stick to it! They were all brilliant! Although I wish there was a little more pork than onions in my dish, it was still extremely good and worth the price I was paying! A must visit if you want to have Korean food-on a budget or not! $40 for all of this, I’m definitely coming back

Name: Kaju Korean Cuisine — Kenmore; Review: Came here for dinner. Pretty straight forward decor inside. No wait on a weekend dinner time. I tried the clay pot bulgogi. Which was a bunch of meat and rice underneath. It tasted ok nothing amazing. I added a lot of their hot sauce to bring some flavor and it was better. My friend tried the tofu soup. They asked for it extra spicy and it felt like medium spicy if you are into spicy food. Tasted like regular tofu soup too. Overall it was average Korean food. Would try if you are in area and looking for Korean but I'm sure better elsewher"
Seafood boil restaurants nearby,"Name: The Fish Shack; Review: Fresh seafood, fresh ingredients. It's not your gourmet calamari, but more like a country style type. Over all, it's one of the best places for fried seafood in Boston. I gave it a 4 because it can made with more flavor
Name: Cap't Loui; Review: Wow, bummed out. Shrimp boil tasted frozen and then over cooked. Calamari so overcooked, you couldn't taste the calamari.  The oysters on the half-shell were the best part. Chowder was... meh.  No crawfish on the menu tonight... Carbonated drinks were also off the menu tonight even with the liquor store right at the corner.  Our server was very nice. He said he would pass our concerns along to the manager. If he did, the manager wasn't interested in hearing anything because they never came to our table.  Really disappointed... So many great restaurants in the area that really do a great job. Wish we hadn't wasted our time
Name: Galo Rei; Review: I've been going here since they first opened and it has been on our takeout restaurant rotation ever since! It's an easy go to when trying to cater to a larger group of people without having to settle for pizza everytime.They also hands down have the best chicken of its kind too! (Def order it Spicy for an extra kick) If seafood is your thing, the owner Sandra makes a killer Seafood rice that is heaping full of seafood for under $20!! Easily feeds two adults or more, as is the case with most of their entrees! Add this to your must try restaurants and you'll easily become a regular....oh and its CASH ONLY so be prepared
Name: Punto Rojo; Review: The best Colombian restaurant I have been in this country !! I live in NY and I came to visit Boston and this place really made me happy with its food and good service, the price for the quality and quantity of food is more than perfect !! I looked at many Reviews of restaurants nearby and this was the best and the best choice! All very tasty!
Name: Dry Dock Cafe; Review: I was so pleasantly surprised, I thought this was going to be just  an ok experience but I walked into Drydock Cafe and the white tablecloths and flowers on every table was a great first impression. The focus of the menu is on seafood but they do have a couple of chicken dishes. The seafood was really fresh, I recommend the grilled seafood platter that included fish, shrimp, and scallops- all delicious. You get to choose 2 sides. They have a wine and beer menu. All prices were very reasonable and the service was very good. I recommend this little known restaurant","Name: Legal Sea Foods - Downtown Crossing; Review: A revist to my hometown and an impromptu dinner at Legal Crossing was extremely disappointing. The service was great however the food was subpar. Clearly mass production of food served causes degradation of it's quality. I ordered the Hoisin glazed salmon and lobster mashed potatoes. It was served in a silver frying pan. To my surprise the frying  pan and the food was were barely room temperature. None of the food was hot! The salmon (under cooked/raw) was served over vegetables and Thai noodles. The noodles were hard and not completely cooked. I think the vegetables were cabbage but lacked color. The whole dish was on a bed  liquid which I could only assume it was water from the vegetables. One oder was returned to the kitchen and there was no reorder. The lemon drop martini was served in very small martini glass. It appears the glass was created specifically to save money for the restaurant while up charging the customer. My point is simple, spending over $100 to eat, you would expect the quality of food to be much much better than this. This restaurant is on a main downtown street. Management needs to police the kitchen from open to close
Name: Luke's Lobster Downtown Crossing; Review: This shop should be Boston's online red lobster restaurant. There is no one to go at noon on weekdays. I ordered a set meal by myself. There are three different types of bread rolls with soup and drinks. The three kinds of rolls are crab, lobster and shrimp, all of which are cold dishes, but they can be eaten very freshly, and you can also see the origin in the shop. For the soup, I choose clam chowder, served with potatoes and black pepper, which is especially comfortable in winter. This restaurant is worth a visit to the Internet celebrity restaurant. You can eat a full meal when you order a set meal, but it is still a bit expensive. It may be the price for seafood.
Name: New Jumbo Seafood Restaurant; Review: I was craving some authentic Chinese style seafood and decided on this place because it was closest to South Station. SOLID CHOICE. We got the black bean sauce clam and the garlic and vermicelli scallops, plus stir fried green beans for veg. The clams were excellent, scallops tasted just like the ones we would find in China, and the green beans were cooked beautifully - nice and crisp with a delicious minced meat base. Staff were your typical Chinese restaurant style, minimal involvement and will bring you whatever you need. We went during off hours so the food came to us quickly. A lady next to us got an entire platter of shrimp and was chowing down so I assume the other seafood dishes on their menu are also good
Name: Legal Sea Foods - Downtown Crossing; Review: I've been here a few times now and have sat at the bar every time. I have been something of a Legal Seafoods Hater for some time but their newest location might have changed my mind on the brand. The bar is sleek and modern and makes for the perfect stop for any kind of pre-theater district activities. the cocktail menu is good, I've had a Tiki drink and their Sangria, both I would order again.  Crab Cakes - Fresh crab cakes that come with a hollandaise type sauce with fried pancetta which is almost like little bites of bacon  White Clam Pizza - Clams, white sauce, and arugula on flatbread. Oh and also little bits of fried pancetta... Is pancetta the new truffle oil? I'm not complaining, it was a must get item and at $11 bucks a bargain. It is perfect for 2 people to split while having some drinks  ""Everything"" Tuna Steak with Cauliflower Risotto - The concept is that it is coated the same as an everything bagel. For me, some salt and pepper would have been just fine. The tuna steak was fine but I've had better, more tender cuts elsewhere. The Cauliflower Risotto was flavorful and light. This dish would also be great for the health conscious
Name: Boston Sail Loft; Review: The best seafood place in the US! Amazing service, super friendly and sincere staff, delicious food, relaxing atmosphere and clean space!

A cup of chowder and a half of tuna salad( you can choose chicken or turkey as well); served on light or dark rye, wheat, light oatmeal or french bread and french fries on a side. Price - $13.50  Also we had Steamed Mussels (Mussels steamed with white wine, garlic and parsley) for appetizer - $15.95  For entree - Single New England Lobster A pound and a quarter lobster served with a bed of mussels. Price -$23.95  I like their prices and atmosphere all around!  There are 3 bathrooms: for ladies, guys and family.

Name: Fisherman's Net; Review: The only Gluten Free Clam Chowder in Quincy Market is served here as well as scallops wrapped in bacon.  The stuffies are tasty and a good choice for a quick seafood snack.  Clams, Fries, Scallops are all on the menu here - a good bunch of people work here.  The offer a good variety of sandwiches here.  Crabmeat, shrimp, fried calamari, fish rolls - New England Seafood is the them here

Name: Cap't Loui; Review: I love this place - one of the best restaurants in Allston! I prefer this place way more than Shaking Crab.  1. It’s never completely packed so you get timely water refills and it’s quiet.  2. Seafood boil is a novelty - very tasty, very interactive, and very communal.  3. Dollar Oyster Tuesday’s are so worth it - the oysters taste fresh and aren’t tiny.  4. The sauce is very tasty, with lots of garlic - TRY THE GARLIC NOODLES IN THE BAG, you won’t regret it as the noodles soak up all the delicious sauce.  5. Complementary mouthwash in the bathroom - how cute and thoughtful is that?  Side note: I wouldn’t get the frozen crawfish, coming in during live crawfish season is much better","Name: Holly Crab; Review: One of the best restaurants in Boston I've been to in the past couple of years.  Eating in a restaurant isn't just about consuming food - it's the whole package: the ambiance, the people, the experience and of course, in the end, the food.  First, the food was amazing. I'm a huge seafood fan and can be selective when it comes to restaurants that specialize in seafood. Also, I'm generally reluctant to try new places because of my delicate tastebud, but the perfectly cooked crab, shells and shrimp forced me to devour without me recognizing how fast I was eating! The sauce was spicy but in a tasty way, and by the end of the meal, couldn't help but yell out, ""holly crab!!!"" (Despite how cheesy that sounds...)  Second, the experience itself was fun! As much as I first didn't like the idea of eating out of a plastic bag using my hands, the whole package was sufficient to keep me perfectly clean even though eating like this can get messy! I was pleasantly flabbergasted!! I think the set up they have created is a phenomenal and clever one, and family gatherings can be really fun with so much action involved in eating :)  Lastly, the staff were really nice!! I consider this to be really important, because we are receiving a form of ""service"" by going to restaurants. Even if a restaurant has amazing food, I cease to go after trying couple of times if I realize that the people do not have service-oriented minds. This place knew how to treat their customers right.  All in all, one of handful of places I would give five stars and even bother to write a review on in Boston. I'm originally from New York and always complain about the food here in Boston, but this will now be my go-to place whenever I'm craving seafood or if friends visit the city! :

Name: Boston Sail Loft; Review: After reading the rave reviews, we decided to make this one of our stops during our visit to Boston. We ended up here late on Sunday night, about 830pm. Luckily, despite all the warnings to the contrary, we were seated immediately. The interior is small,  quaint, and casual, with a nice view of the wharf outside. My husband and I weren't starving but decided to order a cup of the clam chowder since people seemed to love it. We found it to be... okay. To be fair, neither of us are clam chowder connoisseurs, and this was my first. It tastes like creamy potato soup, but add clams and dill.  My husband ordered a whole lobster and side salad. He said it was tasty and we'll prepared. He enjoyed his dish. I ordered the seafood portofino, a linguini dish with lobster, scallops, and shrimp. I found the the seafood tough, overcooked. The wine garlic sauce was very tangy. I didn't quite finish it. The portions were very large l, thought, which is tough to find. The service was ok. The waiter didn't bring utensils so we had to go find some. He also forgot our waters, so we had to wait for him to return to get those. Not horrible offenses. Overall, it was an okay experience. With our meals and two alcohol beverages each, our bill was $116. Not terrible, but if I return, it would probably be to try the lobster Mac n cheese or fish and chips as a lunch option

Name: Pete's Dockside; Review: We stayed at the waterfront area for PAX weekend.  This was my second year going to PAX.  Similar to what I noticed last year, the options for food were not as great by the waterfront as it is in the center of the city.  A quick google search showed us Pete's Dockside rated high, two dollar signs, and walking distance from the Westin hotel (about a 11 minute walk).  At first, from the outside, the place is hard to notice as it is conjoined with a truck warehouse.  But inside is a small  order and sit area, which seats about 15 people.  Based on description, they've been serving fried seafood for years.  I ordered the Seafood Combo, which was a platter of the seasons fried seafood.  My order came with fried haddock, shrimp, and scallops.  The seafood tasted as fresh as implied in the ""dockside"" of the location's name  We also ordered the soup of the day, Fish Chowder.  I had never had fish chowder before, and was a little skeptic, but the fish chowder was just as good or better than any clam chowder I have had to date

Name: Spring Shabu-Shabu; Review: I was super excited to try out this hotpot place, but was ultimately let down. It looks very new and quite clean inside, with many tables that feature individual hotpot cooking spots. What's interesting about this experience compared other buffets, is that they provide AYCE vegetables, noodles, and assortment of fish balls/dumplings/cakes. For the classic meats and seafood, you pay a la carte.  We decided to get all 3 of the a la carte beef options and the seafood combo. These were not impressive. The beef was super annoying because after 5 minutes of sitting out it was thaw a little and all clump together. You therefore ended up with shredded pieces of beef that you had to wrestle apart from each other. The seafood platter had shrimps with heads on, crab, lots of squid/octopus. Meh.  The broth was a huge let down for me, as I really found it to have no flavor. I literally vowwed to bring chicken bouillon powder next time to flavor it up myself. The sauce station is super overwhelming and you somehow usually end up with a concoction that you regret. I asked for salt from the kitchen and made my own salt-sesame oil dipping sauce, the kind you see in Korean bbq.  The only impressive factor is their huge variety and plethora of the included items listed above. So many veggies. So many types of noodles. I also love fish tofu and fish cake, so I ate quite a lot. I'll probably skip out on the a la carte items next time and just have the included AYCE buffet items.  The servers are all pretty young, some of them who are may be at the first job ever. Take it how you will, probably need to be a little patient with them.  Overall I'll likely come back, but I have no real desire to. That broth.....ugh that should be the star of the show! If I wanted to dip things in water....I'd just stay home and boil it all myself

Name: Legal Test Kitchen; Review: Their menu is fantastic! I have been here several times and always impressed by their dishes. The clam chowder is a classic! I would recommend getting at least a cup of it along with your meal - you don't want to miss out! I've had the crab and shrimp etouffee which was very flavorful and had a generous amount of shrimp in it. The crab is tossed on top. The blackened raw tuna sashimi was very fresh and came with a small side of seaweed salad. There was not too much sauce on it, which I appreciated. Great flavor from the seasoning on the sides.  Service was good and the waitresses are very attentive during the times I've visited. A popular place when there's conventions going on in the area - so lunch time it's usually full with people.  Highly suggest trying this out if you're around seaport"
Greek gyro places,"Name: Garbanzo Mediterranean Fresh; Review: I tried Gyro's before for how good they looked on cooking shows.  I was disappointed and never cared to try one again until I came to this place! Wow, the Gyro I had here made me believe again. Would recommend the red sauce over the Saracha any day if you like a bit of spice! Best Gyro I had so far..
Name: Boston House of Pizza; Review: I've eaten here a few times, and honestly its just sad how it gets worse every time.  Ok, I get it, fast food.  Fine, I don't expect great quality.  But for me the last straw is when I order a Gyro Dinner, expecting a Gyro sandwitch, fries, and a salad.  And I get a salad with no dressing, a few slices of meat draped over fries.  There was no Gyro sandwich.  It was literally just slices of the gyro meat(cooked on the stove, not in the usual rotisserie method) draped over some fries.  Why not just call this a ""meaty fries dinner"".  I'm sitting here now, looking at this sad meal, thinking about what went wrong in my life that led to this moment.  But honestly, I can't think of anything I did wrong.  I don't understand how you can call this a Gyro meal and charge $10 for it. There is no Gyro here.  It is just meat.  On fries.  With a dry salad that doesn't have dressing
Name: PITA Restaurant; Review: Had been looking forward to trying this restaurant and too many things went wrong.  Our group of 3 were the only people there so there was ample amount of time/personal to prepare good food.  My brother had a gyro ordered 1st and he struggled to eat it with the cold fries mixed in it.  They shaved my meat and assemble my gyro and left it while they fried a fresh batch of french fries for it.  So if you couldn't guess my gyro was cold.  If you're not ready to assemble and serve the sandwich they should have waited to get the meat.  My husband ordered a falafel gyro and his falafel was under cooked.  My brother and I were also horrified to watch him touch the register with the same gloves he used to handle the food.  He never replaced the gloves after touching the POS......After this horrible meal we all were anticipating some bad food poisoning.  :
Name: Skewers Wood Grill; Review: My experience was mediocre.  Skewer's appears to put their own spin on Greek food which was ok but I prefer traditional.  The gyro was not authentic, the meat had an odd consistency and it was not seasoned very well.  I also felt the sandwich was on the smaller side for the cost. The avgolemono soup on the other hand had an odd seasoning which took away from the usual lemon taste I enjoy.  The greek salad was the first I have had without olives and the lettuce was a bit wilted.  I was not provided plastic utensils for takeout which irked me because I planned on eating it takeout
Name: Campus Trolley; Review: The menu is made up mostly of wraps, but there are some platter options. I had the greek chicken roll up - chicken and vegetables wrapped in pitta. Comes with feta cheese and greek dressing. $6 for the sandwich and they only accept cash","Name: Gyroscope; Review: Their gyros are the best. I love the chicken gyro. It's not dry unlike a lot of other mediterranean places. It's a low key place with fun and quirky decor. Love this place. Also the food is pretty inexpensiv
Name: Mykonos European; Review: There is no better spot for your gyros. That's a guarantee. I've been coming here for over 15 years and so have my family members and friends. They actual season their hamburger meat for their burgers and those are also amazing. Do not waste your time trying a gyro elsewhere..this is where it's at
Name: Zo Greek Cuisine; Review: Zo is one of my two go-to places for gyros.  Both of their brick-and-mortar locations, and their food truck, have some of the best gyros you'll find in the area.  My favorite is the ""original"":  pork gyro meat with tomato, onion, and tzatziki wrapped in a soft pita.  The meat is that salty and savory, complimented by the brightness of the tomatoes and onions.  Everything is pulled together and cooled down with a smothering of tzatziki.  These gyros are messy.  Don't bring a first-date here unless you want to look like you're incapable of feeding yourself.  On your way out, stop at CVS and pick up a roll of paper towels just so you can keep your composure while you feast.  Service here is *fast*.  If there's a line out the door, don't let it deter you... they fly through the line.  There is extremely limited seating in all of the locations, it's meant to be a takeout place
Name: Gyro City; Review: Gyros are pretty good, generally. Usually, as with most gyros, they're better earlier in the day, when they've spent a little less time on the rotisserie. It's a little fatty - up to you if you're into that. Their fries though? Hot dang. A pretty good tip is to tuck some of those fries into your sandwich. If you get a sandwich to go, they'll package some fries in with it, which makes it easier to do that.  Their box/dinner portions are gigantic, and the meat doesn't keep very well in the fridge, so if you're gonna get that, you'd best be either sharing or very hungry

Name: Atha's Famous Roast Beef; Review: I was not impressed at all.the steak n cheese sub was way over priced and almost unedible it was so dry.the bread seemed old.not soft whatsoever. Everything on the menu was overpriced in my opinion.although there is a huge selection of pizza.subs.and dinner plates. Maybe if they shortened the menu to a few specialties and bumped up the quality of food . they would be a place I'd return to. Me being Greek I was drawn there by the name and was dissapointed to see not much of a selection of Greek ingredients and more Italian. Gyros. With lamb and feta cheese.souvlaki should be on skewers with tomatoes onion or veggies. Not just said to be grille

Name: Zo Greek Cuisine; Review: I tested ZO State St this year in August. Gyros chicken and gyros original (pork). It's not bad, the produce is fresh but I'm sorry it's not Greek food. Visually it looks but tastefully it's bland, not bad but bland. And no one speaks Greek here.  I tasted ZO State St this year in august. Gyros chicken and original gyros (pork) It's not bad food the products are fresh but I'm sorry it's not greek cuisine. In your hand it looks like a kitchen in your mouth it's bland and tasteless. And nobody speaks greek here!  Δοκίμασα ΖΟ φέτος τον Αύγουστο. Γύρος κοτόπουλο και πρωτότυπο γύρο (χοιρινό) Δεν είναι κακό φαγητό, τα προϊόντα είναι φρέσκα, αλλά λυπάμαι που δεν είναι ελληνικό φαγητό Στα χέρια μου μοιάζει με ελληνικό φαγητό αλλά στο στόμα μου είναι άγευστο. Και εδώ δεν κανείς μιλάει τα Ελληνικά!

Name: Chicken And Rice Guys; Review: Small chicken salad dish with some garlic sauce on the side - done deal. Best quick pickup lunch that leaves me satisfied if I want something light with protien. A large rice plate with beef/gyro for good filling lunch and maybe a little to bring home for dinner. For the volume of customers that come through - I've never once felt like I was waiting out of reasonable time EVER for my order to be ready. In fact I'm constantly surprised with how fast the turnaround is - and bonus the food is still prepped nicely. It's not sloppy like some other shops that just throw everything in there"
Vietnamese banh mi spots,"Name: Ba Lẹ Restaurant; Review: Banh Mi Ba Le definitely takes the trophy for best banh mi in New England! The trek out to Dorchester is worth it every time. They are my go-to for banh mi and it's really nice that they offer a lot of other freshly prepared Vietnamese food cafeteria style for other meal options. Also plenty of desserts in the refrigerated section! I love that they sell banh bot loc and banh trang tron because they're two of my favorite snacks. I'm a banh mi fanatic and crave it 24/7 so believe me when I say Banh Mi Ba Le hits the spot always. Portions are good and prices are reasonable. The bread is freshly baked in house and has a good texture. They fill your banh mis up with meat - no skimping here. The carrots and daikon are picked well and the cucumber, cilantro and jalapenos are all fresh. I love love love that the banh mis are ooooozing pate and butter because that's my favorite part. You know that last bite where the pate and butter/mayo has trickled down to that last piece of bread? That's the best bite
Name: Ba Lẹ Restaurant; Review: Two part review. First part - banh mi. Hard pass on the banh mi. Two reasons, the bread is on the denser side, while it looks like a traditional Vietnamese banh mi roll, it has a more dense consistency, and when paired with the second issue - the BBQ beef was either stale or the cut of meat not cooked properly, makes for a bad combo. For banh mi, stick to the hole in the wall place New Saigon Sandwich in Chinatown next to the Pho Pastuer, consistently always better all around. Second part review would be for the rest of the cafe. Lots of offerings in terms of snacks, from bubble tea to spring and fresh rolls. The highlight being banh cuon. Few places in Boston area carry it, Ba Le does it solid with their rendition. Soft fresh rice noodle, u assuming and tender ground pork and wood ear mushrooms, accompanied by steamed bean sprouts, crispy spring roll, cha lua chien, and nouc mam dipping sauce. Large serving, cheap price, all the happiness. Save appetite from banh mi and hit the hot bar, you won’t regret it
Name: Bánh Mì Boston; Review: I got the BBQ Beef Banh Mi Sandwich and iced Vietnamese coffee with Matcha Boba. Both were amazing! I highly recommend going here for authentic Vietnamese cuisine. Everyone working there was incredibly friendly and I look forward to returning
Name: Pho Viet’s; Review: I needed a grab and go lunch in Newton after dropping off a UPS package and decided to give Pho Viet's a try. After calling about 10 minutes away and placing my order, I was happy to see it ready to go when I arrived. For $18 after tax and tip, I got two banh mis (not just for myself! I ordered for my partner too) and an order of summer rolls. Everything was super fresh, the veggies (fresh and pickled) were nice and crisp, and both the pork and ham banh mi was excellent, with lots of lard paste and big cuts of meat. The bread was incredible! Crispy without being overly hard, it didn't feel like an obstacle to the meat and veggies of the banh mi but a true complement, which I find rare.  For a quick and very affordable lunch (that banh mi kept me full until way past dinnertime), Pho Viet's seems like a great place to go. I'll definitely be back to try their noodle soups next
Name: Pho Viet’s; Review: Okay, that was just ridiculously good.  I've been craving banh mi and eggrolls, and knowing I was going to be in the area, I searched Yelp for options and found Pho Viet's as a highly-rated option.  And justifiably so.  I ordered the chicken banh mi and the Vietnamese Spring Rolls.  I knew I wouldn't be able to eat it all (I was right), but I didn't care.  I wanted these dishes.  Ordering was easy, and everything was clearly made fresh.  There was a family of three who has been visiting for the last two years, and the gentleman taking orders recognized them.  There is open seating in the Food Court but not many seats.  I wanted to head home anyway.  The Banh Mi was chock full of love, where love = delicious chicken, fresh, pickled vegetables, special sauce, and a fantastic crunchy baguette.  I probably ate half and I enjoyed every bite.  The Vietnamese Spring Rolls were awesome and exactly what I had been craving.  The order came with three rolls.  I ate one.  It also came with some sort of rice noodle salad with iceberg, cucumber, and mint, and, I'm embarrassed to say, I just didn't know what to do with it!  In terms of COVID, everyone I saw working there was wearing masks & gloves and there was a shield up between the customer and the server.  If you are in the area and want some really great food, I definitely recommend Pho Viet's","Name: Banh Mi Ok; Review: Tried their shrimp spring rolls, BBQ pork Bahn Mi and, Beef Bahn Mi shared with my husband for late lunch. The Google reviews are right; Dishes were amazingly delicious! BBQ Bahn Mi is a little sweater side and I liked it. Pickled radish/carrot mix wasn't very sweet or sour. It was perfect! Usually fresh chopped Jalapeno peppers are added to Vietnamese Sandwiches but I didn't see in my pork sandwich (it wasn't a big deal because I don't like fresh jalapenos anyway.. Too spicy for me!). If you like chopped jalapeno pepper pieces, I guess you will need to make a request. I hope I can stop by again when I have something to do in Boston downtown area

Highly recommend the special, which is your usual cold cuts. My food friends confidently say that the bbq pork and bbq beef are also very tasty
Name: Banh Mi Ok; Review: The most amazing place! A must go! The food is incredible! Every item is fresh, generous and delicious. The BBQ pork Banh Mi is to die for. The egg roll is crisp and tasty.

Name: Ba Lẹ Restaurant; Review: This place is a staple for Vietnamese sandwiches (called banh mi). In fact, it's the best place in town. The popular sandwiches are probably the cold cut and the grilled beef, but you can't go wrong with the any of them. Beyond sandwiches, this place has an uncountable variety of delicious soups (such as banh canh), porridge, egg rolls, snacks, beef jerky, bubble tea, coffee, and much more. Come here with an open mind and try something new. Don't be overwhelmed by the options and the organization of the shop; it takes getting used to. There will be mainly Asian shoppers here and they may cut you in line if you look confused, but the employees there are super nice and will get you what you want. There are no tables or chairs here, it's a grab and go type of place.

Steakhouse delivery near me,"Name: Pad Thai Cafe; Review: It's sad to say that this restaurant is getting worse and worse. I order food delivery from them every week and every time when the order is delayed, I have to be the one contact the delivery guy. I ordered food today and 2 hrs passed I still haven't heard from the delivery guy. I called the restaurant and no one trying to help they don't even have a contact number of the delivery man. I will not go back. Very disappointed. At the end I I got the food late but it's not my order. I randomly get something else but not Thai food. This is ridiculous. I lost my money and I didn't get anything
Name: Emilio's Pizza; Review: They deliver ! But wouldn't deliver the food to my door , the driver parked down the street and told me to walk but got an attitude bc I explained that I pay for delivery so no matter what he needed to bring me my delivery !

Name: CHINA GARDEN; Review: My son love this place n he happy that it near us... food are so delicious and fresh.. good quality!!.
Name: Rock City Pizza; Review: If I could review this place as a 0, I would. Placed an order at 12:15 am, nothing outstanding with a late night order. Delivery estimate was 1 am, seemed normal. Around 1:30 am, I called inquiring about my order. Individual told me that the delivery driver was 10 minutes out. After another half hour, I called again. Same answer, delivery driver was 10 minutes out. After a total wait time of about 2 hours, I called again. They told me delivery driver attempted to make a delivery. The person never called, never rang my apartment or anything. Normally, I'd forgive and forget, but this is the third terrible experience I've had ordering from Rock City. Their food is good, but their overall service may be hands down the worst thing I've experienced in Brighton. I doubt I will order from their establishment again. There are many other places in the area that provide a similar experience for a more reliable one
Name: Bangkok Pinto; Review: disclaimer: i have never ever step a foot into this restaurant or even been nearby this place. however, i have ordered delivery three times through Yelp Eat 24 from this place. never had a bad delivery experience from here. they would always come right on time. in fact, i think they even time themselves to be here on time at my front door. if i order it at 1pm, they would be knocking on my door at 1pm. food would still be hot too. wonderful! so far, i have seen two different delivery guys from my past three orders. both very nice. each time they would say hi, ask for my name/confirmation, give me the food then say have a nice day, and leave without expecting a tip. i have to be the one to stop them to give them their deserved tip.  the first time i ordered delivery through yelp was from the lunch menu. it was the first time ever ordering through this restaurant and wasn't sure how big the portions were for lunch. surprisingly, it was a regular entree size portion! and it tasted good!  if delivery can be this good, i'm pretty sure eating inside the restaurant will be super with great service and excellent food","Name: Jumbo Grill & Pizzeria; Review: Happy to find a late night place with delivery and roast beef. Skeptical.  Happy to say delivery was on time if not early; the sandwich was large, rare, and awesome (although I did give it a few seconds in the microwave -- but realistically, no delivery will be as hot as you'd get it in the restaurant itself).  I asked for extra bbq sauce on the side - got it.  Asked for a soda, got it and they handed it to me separate from the bag with my hot sandwich so they didn't make each other luke warm. I ordered after 11pm on a Tuesday.  Based upon my experience tonight, they earned a speed dial place on my phone
Name: LongHorn Steakhouse; Review: 3 couples, one from out of state, early dinner. Called ahead and were seated within 10 minutes of arriving. Server pleasant but....  5 of our meals came way too fast, less then 2 minutes after our salads had been delivered. Pet peeve: the servers stood there, both hands full, expecting us to make room on the table. And, the 6th meal, also a ribeye steak, was mysteriously delayed another 10-15 minutes (or actually served at the correct interval.) On the plus side, everything was cooked as requested, although the larger ribeyes were not noticeably bigger than the regular ones. Everyone said the steaks were tasty but way too salty, as were my shrimp. A hostess came by to hear our complaints about meals being served too quickly and the missing steak, and made soothing noises, hinted at comping us dessert, but essentially did nothing. We've eaten here enough times to have expected better
Name: Ruth's Chris Steak House; Review: Steak so good, I asked if I could slap the chef. Seriously, there shouldn't be a steak that tastes that good. But be prepared to pay for it. This is a 100+ per meal style restaurant. And it feels shameful to call it that. Is there a better word? Steak joint? No because you don't have to smoke it. Outlet? Nah that sounds cheap. Okay steak castle. Because the underground seating reminded me of a castle of sorts as there were bricks and arches all around in the ""dungeon"". Seriously I think we were in a basement. But it was a lovely basement, with plenty of seating, lights, and some window access if needed. Professional service all around. A wine menu that will have even the snobbiest of snobs tipping their fedoras to the sommelier. So started with the calamari, which I don't like, but I admit it was actually impressive and tasty. Also, because it came out a minute late, they took it off of the tab. Win! For dinner, I went with the sirloin (medium rare) and roasted root vegetables. I will never not eat roasted vegetables again. Let me tell you when I roasted vegetables at home, they just get sad because I point out their poor life choices. But these tasted like melted cubes of butter and potatoes, only vegetable flavor. Absolutely delicious. The steak...I've never made a face when eating meat. But I made a face. People thought I was having a stroke, but it was just so good, it melted in my mouth. Meat is not supposed to melt like that. Or taste that good. It was cooked to perfection and came out sizzling on the plate (like in a commercial). It was appealing visually, audibly, and smellably. The rosemary drink special they had was decadent, the Caesar salad had perfect portion of cheese/croutons and wasn't too salty, and the old fashion was a joy to consume. Often, you don't get quite what you pay for, but here, you leave feeling like it was worth it. Unlike divorce
Name: Texas Roadhouse; Review: Want a delicious mouthwatering NY strip steak??? Oh boy, this is the place to go!  Have been here several times, (recommend getting there early as you will be waiting to be seated)  We usually will sit at the bar, as you get faster service and the bartenders are very attentive. Make sure you go with an appetite, you will most certainly leave there stuffed to the gills!  Bar area is small, but cozy.  I always order the NY strip steak, moderately priced and worth every penny.  You start with a nice drink, order your meal and  while waiting there is a bucket of peanuts to snack on, but once they bring the rolls, you will forget the peanuts. Hot delicious rolls served with cinnamon butter, to die for (really)  While you are there, you may catch the waitstaff doing a line dance or them singing to a customer celebrating their birthday, always entertaining!!  The meal comes in a reasonable time cooked to perfection, nice portions. The steak literally melts in your mouth. Served with a baked potato and veggies the meal is fantastic.  They do have a desert menu, but honestly we have never had any, as we are way to full!  Again GO here if you want awesome steaks!
Name: Caribbean Flavors (Boston); Review: Delivery...  9 dollars for a steak and cheese on coco bread that I promise you had no steak at all!  I'm very disappointed in this.   Thought it ( their steak and cheese) would be like Lenny's right across the street that closed and I was really wrong,  wasn't even close. I really wish I could post a picture of this for all to see, no way I'd let this leave my store for 9 dollars.  You'd think small businesses like this would get the picture during times like these and apparently they do not.   I ordered at 725, they close at 9... so I'm aware of closing times but In no way should this of be given out with this little amount of meat","Name: Jumbo Grill & Pizzeria; Review: Happy to find a late night place with delivery and roast beef. Skeptical.  Happy to say delivery was on time if not early; the sandwich was large, rare, and awesome (although I did give it a few seconds in the microwave -- but realistically, no delivery will be as hot as you'd get it in the restaurant itself).  I asked for extra bbq sauce on the side - got it.  Asked for a soda, got it and they handed it to me separate from the bag with my hot sandwich so they didn't make each other luke warm. I ordered after 11pm on a Tuesday.  Based upon my experience tonight, they earned a speed dial place on my phone

Name: LongHorn Steakhouse; Review: Decent local steakhouse. Tucked next to Dollar tree in the Hannaford plaza. Not 5 stars because many times steak will be under or overcooked. Also, if they ask if you want pepper on the steak say no. They had a problem with over peppering steaks because when I complained that I couldn't eat the steak because it was like someone dumped a whole pepper shaker on it, waiter said many have complained about the pepper. Last visit no one asked about pepper so maybe they did away with asking and putting pepper on steaks. Disappointed they got rid of the porterhouse for 2 meal, which was a great deal if you were ok with sharing with the person you were dining with. If looking for steak I would recommend this location because they do have a variety of steak and price options. Also call ahead seating is available

Name: Stromboli's Express; Review: The food is good but don't expect to get it delivered in a timely fashion or get honest answers as to when it'll be delivered. I usually pick up because it's faster but there are times where I prefer delivery. About a month or so ago on a random weeknight I ordered two items and asked to have it delivered. I was told it would be here in 30-45 mins and after waiting 45 mins I called to see where they were and was told he was on his way. The problem was it still didn't arrive for another 30 mins and I live 10 mins away. The food was cold and we had to reheat it. I wasn't happy. I called to talk to the manager and was told it wasn't his fault, that they should have told me an hour. I said it still wouldn't have been here on time and either way the food was cold. The manager got angry and said he was busy and couldn't talk to me and asked what I wanted him to do. I asked him to fix it and again he said he was too busy

Name: Kelley Square Pub; Review: I was staying at a hotel nearby and figured I’d order from this place since the hotel was advertising it and it has 4.5 stars on google. Quick delivery but the food was inedible I had mozzarella sticks and fries which were both terrible and cold some how even with the delivery being fast. The most unsettling part of this experience was the steak and cheese sub, after 2 bites I discovered a plethora of bugs (weevils) as shown in the photos.That meat did not taste like steak, it was so dry and rough. I was sick for the rest of the day and lost my appetite for days. It made me not trust any restaurant.  I got a full refund but that didn’t make up for anything as I was sick the whole day. I let the hotel know and they said they would stop advertising this place","Name: Sixth Gear - Cask & Kitchen; Review: . We ordered the Black and Blue Burger cooked medium. I ordered the Broadway sirloin cooked well done.  The dinners were brought to us with the burger cooked well and the steak cooked medium. I could not eat the steak the way it was prepared so I sent it back to be cooked a bit longer. My husband was hungry so he ate the burger even though it was over cooked.  When the waitress eventually brought my food back out again, the steak was still medium well. By that time, my husband had already finished eating his over cooked burger and I knew I didn't have enough time to send the steak back to the kitchen again, so I asked for my dinner to go and told the waitress I would take it home and cook it myself.  There were only 2 other patrons in the restaurant. No reason for our order to not be right.

Name: JAK PIZZERIA; Review: Drove about an hour but it was worth it. Had the steak and cheese.  If u like, t.c lando's, you will love this steak and cheese.

Name: Olympic House of Pizza; Review: Best steak fries, generous servings and price (can't beat the chicken tenders dinner) and quick with delivery. Ordered numerous items there from the wraps to the steak bomb. Awesome place, plus GrubHub only $1 fee and low minimum

Name: Sidewalk Cafe South Boston; Review: This place is a hidden gem!!! They serve everything from breakfast to dinner. My all time favorite is the marinated steak tips ( I get mine well done, cut small, extra marinade sauce)  and I mix it into their rice pilaf, Mmmm🤪.....!!!! You won't want steak from any other take out again!!!! And to top it off... they deliver my snickerdoodle iced coffee and rasberry/lime rickys!!!!!!! Only rated 4 stars because I heard they no longer deliver!!!!

Name: Boston Chops South End; Review: OMG! WOW! MEGA! etc, etc, etc ...  When looking for a steakhouse in Boston, the choice is relatively manageable, but high priced, they are all. But the Boston Chops is still the cheapest and has promised me the most from the map. Especially as far as the side dishes were concerned, these were not quite as unusual as at the other steakhouses. Also not quite as fish-heavy as in the other restaurants.   There are two Boston Chops, this was closer to our hotel so we could walk there. Both are beautifully decorated, stylish and almost luxurious. Nice with the dimmed light, the walls and furniture are also rather dark. My reservation had worked out and we got a nice 2s table quite central. Our service Alex was super nice and I was very happy that we were sitting at his table. Especially as far as steaks were concerned he was a great help as there are many steaks to choose from and I do not know all the steaks, but his descriptions were great. I decided to go for the 400 gram Prime Rib Eye Steak and was in heaven, so tender and delicious !!! I also had homemade macaroni and cheese, also gigantic. You should bring a lot of hunger, the portions are large. Before that there was still bread from the kitchen with butter, also great. The woman had a cauliflower steak (vegetarian) with asparagus, she also raved about. A bottle of wine (the selection of wines is great) with a dessert which we shared, and then we were already at 160 € for the evening. With tips 200 €, but I would always pay again, everything was OK !!!!   Clear recommendation on my part !!"
Ethiopian injera restaurants,"Name: Lucy Ethiopian Cafe; Review: First time trying Ethiopian food and had an overall good experience at Lucy. Came for lunch at noon on a Sunday after a snow storm so we were one of two groups there.  Setting: nothing special. Tile floor in the bottom of a building on Mass Ave. You don't come to the Ethiopian restaurants for the ambiance.  Service: Very nice waitress who gave us an extra side dish...it pays to be nice to people!  Food: So for those who haven't had Ethiopian food before, it often comes on this thin bread called Injera (made from Teff flour). You use the bread, which is chewy, to scoop up all the yummy flavors in front of you. We ordered the combo for two which came with well-spiced beef chunks in the middle surrounded by lentils, potatoes, spinach, chickpea, and collard greens. The beef was my favorite part of the meal but I was slightly disappointed that the injera and some of the sides weren't warm...I expected everything to be at least warm, if not hot. The flavors were there across the board, just the temperature of the food could be improved (perhaps it was a fluke!).  Definitely not a place to take a first date...it's hard to have good manners eating Ethiopian food
Name: Addis Red Sea; Review: I love the entire experience of eating Ethiopian food. And Addis Red Sea is one of the best places for it.  We came early for dinner on a Friday evening and were promptly ushered to a table. We ordered the Tej (Ethiopian honey wine) and the Ethiopian tea. Both were excellent. The wine was sweet as expected. Ethiopian tea isn't served with milk but is spiced, and was quite tasty.  We ordered the doro alcha combination with three veggies and the yasa tibs (fried fish fillet). All of it served with injera, a spongy crepe. The experience of sharing your food is really great! The injera here is not too sour for which I'm thankful. The chicken in the doro alcha was tender and well cooked. All the veggie dishes were tasty too. The yasa tibs however was bland, no spices at all and didn't taste quite fresh.  Service was attentive and all our questions regarding the food were answered. The ambiance is pretty cozy too. A little dimly lit with beautiful Ethiopian artifacts and paintings adorning the walls.  There are so many different options to try on their menu, that we'll surely be back soon. Can't wait to try their sambusa
Name: Blue Nile Restaurant; Review: The injera was not fresh at all and that is the base of the meal. This is my first and LAST time here. The restaurants in the DMV are WAY better and I am still looking for a restaurant similar. There is also a weird rule that one ""entree"" per person but normally Ethiopian food is ordered to share. They also forgot my drink and did not serve anyone water until a white family came in. The tea normally called chai that we ordered was not Ethiopian tea (normally classified by certain spices) but rather Lipton tea and a stick of cinnamon. The apple and white grape cider was 3.50 and served in a wine glass when it was s glorified small serving of sparkling welches juice. We also requested a side of tomato salad which is a common side in Ethiopian foods and was ensured that all entrees come with a salad that is filled with tomatoes instead we were met with a disappointment to salads everywhere there was literally 2 slices of tomato. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else that has more reasonable prices because this is not representative of the wonderful culture that comes from Ethiopia
Name: Addis Red Sea; Review: The food was not hot when we got it. I was told that we would have to pay a surcharge for small plates and forks to eat a cake that we bought for my childs bday. We waited almost an hour to get the food. Today I went back to just order injera and they are charging $2 for each 1. He said because they are giving it away in the restaurant for free with the meals. They will not be getting anymore of my money. I now have to find a new restaurant.  Update: I have been back to the restaurant since because they do have the best injera. The last time we ate in we waited 30 minutes and then decided to walk out because no one addressed us. The manager caught me and apologized then offered a free appetizer which the kids loved (they got to try something new). Yesterday I sent my daughter in to get just injera and they would not allow her to get it and she has done it before. She signed my name which would have been fine because there is no signature on my card and the purchase was under $25 (no signature is required). I did send her in a second time with my ID. The owner came out and stated he knew I did the bad review, initially told him no because I did not remember, I have done a lot of reviews. I searched and found this. He was very nice and I told him that we drive all the way there because we love the injera and I don’t mind paying the $2. The shock was that I was told one price on the phone then went to pick it up and was given another. People raise prices all the time. He even offered other solutions when there is no parking
Name: Lucy Ethiopian Cafe; Review: Mostly a coffee house with some standard sandwich fare, Lucy also has several FANTASTIC ethiopian items on their very affordable, made to order menu. The chalkboard menu, full of fun factoids about Ethiopia, changes to offer regular customers a range of food over time. Potently flavorful, but not painfully spicy (though you can request a delicious homemade hot sauce if that's how you prefer it), most dishes come with spongy, slightly tangy injera bread to act as your primary eating utensil. They also have a room in the back where they offer elaborate Ethiopian coffee ceremonies. The owner and staff are so incredibly proud of what they do here, and they have every right to be.

Name: Blue Nile Restaurant; Review: This past Sunday we went for lunch to an Ethiopian restaurant, ""Blue Nile"" in Jamaica Plain. The restaurant itself is quite small, located in a busy neighborhood. We ordered 4 different dishes along with their in-house honey wine. The wine was bit too sweet for us, but was okay. The food took almost 20 minutes to arrive at our table, but food was delicious! We ordered one lamb dish (Yebeg Tibs), two beef dishes (Lega Tibs & Tibs Fir Fir) and one vegetarian combo dish (with Misir Wet, Shiro Wet, Yatakilt Wet & Yekik Alicha). Food was served on the traditional Ethiopean bread Injera, which you will find similar in texture and taste to Indian Dosa. The lamb and beef dishes were quite spicy but were very tasty. The vegetarian combo meal was less spicy, but was great too! If you crave for spicy food, you should definitely try this place; I am going back soon

Name: Addis Red Sea; Review: I've been too both the Cambridge and Boston locations now, but prefer the schlep to Cambridge from Brookline, instead of Back Bay. I order the vegetarian platter for 2, which is what I order at about any Ethiopian restaurant, and added a beef dish as well. I wasn't fond of the ""white"" injera the brown teff is much more flavorful, and a couple of the dishes I chose for the platter  (similar or the same to ones I always choose) were pretty bland. Good, but bland.  Wait staff was pleasant, and compensated our beverage orders because they were out of an original choice of something we wanted to order.  The Cambridge location is fairly wheelchair accessible, well barrier free at least, this one is downstairs. So if you're mobility impaired in regards to stairs, just be advised there are about a half a flight, and no railing. I left my wheelchair folded up in the bushes, while my family helped my down

Name: Lucy Ethiopian Cafe; Review: There is a bad attitude in this restaurant towards a member of their own Ethiopian community even though they use the name ""Ethiopian"" cafe & restaurant for their business, I had a horrible experience in this restaurant when I tried to pick up my ordered food, the front service guy had intentionally tried to humiliate me and let me to wait when he saw another white person who came after me, so when I picked my food he grabbed my hand up to my shirt tore and my covid face mask fall off plus insulted me and he was about to fight with me for no reason, then I called to the police, all this happened just for the sake of under $20 food.  I don't recommend this cafe especially for Ethiopians"
Cajun crawfish places,"Name: Augusta Market; Review: Best Cajun chicken sub ever! They make their own chicken. The rolls are always soft and the sauce is the perfect balance of delicious spicy to the point where you will sweat a little but not so hot that you have to wash it down with milk to put out the fire in your mouth. If you've ever enjoyed wings of mass distruction from east coast grill you need to eat this Cajun chicken sub. I've been eating here for decades and they consistently nail it every time
Name: Cap't Loui; Review: I love this place - one of the best restaurants in Allston! I prefer this place way more than Shaking Crab.  1. It’s never completely packed so you get timely water refills and it’s quiet.  2. Seafood boil is a novelty - very tasty, very interactive, and very communal.  3. Dollar Oyster Tuesday’s are so worth it - the oysters taste fresh and aren’t tiny.  4. The sauce is very tasty, with lots of garlic - TRY THE GARLIC NOODLES IN THE BAG, you won’t regret it as the noodles soak up all the delicious sauce.  5. Complementary mouthwash in the bathroom - how cute and thoughtful is that?  Side note: I wouldn’t get the frozen crawfish, coming in during live crawfish season is much better
Name: Shaking Crab (Boston Common); Review: A unique and special food excursion that must be tried! Everything is incredibly tasty, from the fried lobster tail appetizer to all the various sauces that the main seafood boils/bags come with. As long as you aren't afraid to get a little messy and eat with your hands, this is one of the top seafood restaurants around (and even with takeout they do supply gloves and bibs). I personally get the Alaskan king crab legs, which is a relative steal for what they charge. The shrimp and crawfish are also excellent, but take a little more work to get to the meat. As someone who can't handle a lot of spice, I go for the butter and garlic sauce which is nice, but I wish they had a milder version of the Cajun sauce as that flavor is amazing. And definitely don't forget the fries for dipping in the sauce
Name: Cap't Loui; Review: Wow, bummed out. Shrimp boil tasted frozen and then over cooked. Calamari so overcooked, you couldn't taste the calamari.  The oysters on the half-shell were the best part. Chowder was... meh.  No crawfish on the menu tonight... Carbonated drinks were also off the menu tonight even with the liquor store right at the corner.  Our server was very nice. He said he would pass our concerns along to the manager. If he did, the manager wasn't interested in hearing anything because they never came to our table.  Really disappointed... So many great restaurants in the area that really do a great job. Wish we hadn't wasted our time
Name: Bootleg Special; Review: A cajun restaurant that does brunch...sure, why not? What's cool about Bootleg Special is they have traditional brunch items as well as the typical brunch items with a cajun twist...and of course, SOUFFLE PANCAKES! There aren't too many places that serve them so our main objective in coming here was trying them. It's a pretty cool dish but something I probably wouldn't order again. They are sweeter than your usual pancakes but they're light and fluffy. Some of ours were undercooked - for the most part they look cute and well done on the exterior but one of ours split open before we even cut into it and you could see the underdone interior (see attached photo). I like that they provided syrup, butter, AND condensed milk though! I definitely recommend sharing if you decide to get the souffle pancakes because you'll eventually get tired of eating the same thing over and over again.  The Traditional Benedict was pretty basic but not bad. We also got the Bootleg Mussel Bowl which was an interesting thing to have on the brunch menu but ok! I'm all for it. It was super flavorful and extremely garlicky with a kick. It also came with a side of pretty solid fries. Unfortunately my breath was kickin' for the rest of the day from the ridiculous amount of garlic, haha. When you look at Bootleg Special from the outside, you don't really see much because it's right next to a CVS and it looks pretty plain Jane. The interior is gorgeous though. There's an old charm to it with some tasteful rustic-ness","Name: Cap't Loui; Review: I love this place - one of the best restaurants in Allston! I prefer this place way more than Shaking Crab.  1.

Complementary mouthwash in the bathroom - how cute and thoughtful is that?  Side note: I wouldn’t get the frozen crawfish, coming in during live crawfish season is much better
Name: Cajun & Grill; Review: Tried a sample of some of the food as I was passing by. Very delicious and great flavoring. I will try the next time I step out of the office for lunch
Name: French Quarter; Review: Finally! Boston finally has an authentic New Orleans style restaurant. Everything from the cocktails to the desserts feel like they were ubered up from NOLA right then and there.  We visited the restaurant last month for a celebratory dinner and pigged out on just about everything. The crab cakes, fried chicken, BLACKENED SALMON, beignets, and bourbon pecan pie were ALL out of this world.  Seriously, I can’t recommend this restaurant enough. I’ve been raving about it to everyone I know. In a post Covid world, I’m sure this place is going to be packed every weekend
Name: Cajun & Grill; Review: I stopped by this place to take some Mexican food to go for my trip back to NYC. I ordered a bowl which consisted of grilled chicken, rice, beans and everything else I could possibly fit into the bowl. The portion was generous as I was able to have 2 portions - 1 for dinner and the other for lunch the next day. Was very filling and satisfying. A bowl and a bottle of water came to about $11 with tax
Name: Shaking Crab (Boston Common); Review: A unique and special food excursion that must be tried! Everything is incredibly tasty, from the fried lobster tail appetizer to all the various sauces that the main seafood boils/bags come with. As long as you aren't afraid to get a little messy and eat with your hands, this is one of the top seafood restaurants around (and even with takeout they do supply gloves and bibs). I personally get the Alaskan king crab legs, which is a relative steal for what they charge. The shrimp and crawfish are also excellent, but take a little more work to get to the meat. As someone who can't handle a lot of spice, I go for the butter and garlic sauce which is nice, but I wish they had a milder version of the Cajun sauce as that flavor is amazing. And definitely don't forget the fries for dipping in the sauce","Name: Cap't Loui; Review: I love this place - one of the best restaurants in Allston! I prefer this place way more than Shaking Crab.  1. It’s never completely packed so you get timely water refills and it’s quiet.  2. Seafood boil is a novelty - very tasty, very interactive, and very communal.  3. Dollar Oyster Tuesday’s are so worth it - the oysters taste fresh and aren’t tiny.  4.

Name: Red Crab Juicy Seafood; Review: Dont let the food in the bag fool u... this stuff is amazzingggg... Crab legs 🦀...Shrimp🦐... Lobster🦞....w corn 🌽and potatoes🥔🥔...all in a cajun garlic butter spicy sauce...sooo good!!.. messy af, but deelishhhh!!!.. put ur man bib on, glove up and dive in.. if ur a seafood lover, i assure U, u  will NOT b disappointed!!!

Name: Augusta Market; Review: Best Cajun chicken sub ever! They make their own chicken. The rolls are always soft and the sauce is the perfect balance of delicious spicy to the point where you will sweat a little but not so hot that you have to wash it down with milk to put out the fire in your mouth. If you've ever enjoyed wings of mass distruction from east coast grill you need to eat this Cajun chicken sub. I've been eating here for decades and they consistently nail it every time

Name: Cap't Loui; Review: Wow, bummed out. Shrimp boil tasted frozen and then over cooked. Calamari so overcooked, you couldn't taste the calamari.  The oysters on the half-shell were the best part. Chowder was... meh.  No crawfish on the menu tonight... Carbonated drinks were also off the menu tonight even with the liquor store right at the corner.  Our server was very nice. He said he would pass our concerns along to the manager. If he did, the manager wasn't interested in hearing anything because they never came to our table.  Really disappointed... So many great restaurants in the area that really do a great job. Wish we hadn't wasted our time","Name: Shaking Crab (Boston Common); Review: A unique and special food excursion that must be tried!

Name: Holly Crab; Review: I came on a weekday for dinner and there were plenty of seating so my party of 7 was seated immediately. The service was pretty good and the food came out at a reasonable time so it didn't take too long to wait for the food.  The seafood that comes in bags are what they're known for so I got shrimp, snow crab legs, and clams. I tried the Holly sauce and the Sweet Holly sauce. The sweet Holly sauce was actually really good. They also give free baguette bread that you can use to dip in the sauce and it's perfect because it soaks up the juices from the sauce. It would be better if the baguettes were warmed up though. You can also get rice and have it over rice which is also good. The shrimp didn't come out of the shell smoothly, sadly, but everything else was good.  As for some additional foods: - Cheesy noodles were decent but not as good as I hoped. It was kind of greasy. - Their wings are super crispy and very juicy. But, they were small pieces of wings so not a lot of meat in it and didn't have a lot of sauce covering it. - The boneless breasts were pretty good too. Like the wings, it was really crispy and the pieces were pretty thin. - Cajun Fries were good. A bit spicy for those not tolerant to spice.  Overall, a great seafood boil spot that also serves nice Korean style fried chicken! It's definitely a good spot to come with friends to share food and socialize as you eat messily together. At the end of your meal, you might feel a bit greasy from all the sauce settling in but it's a good experience and tasty

Name: Legal Test Kitchen; Review: Their menu is fantastic! I have been here several times and always impressed by their dishes. The clam chowder is a classic! I would recommend getting at least a cup of it along with your meal - you don't want to miss out! I've had the crab and shrimp etouffee which was very flavorful and had a generous amount of shrimp in it. The crab is tossed on top. The blackened raw tuna sashimi was very fresh and came with a small side of seaweed salad. There was not too much sauce on it, which I appreciated. Great flavor from the seasoning on the sides.  Service was good and the waitresses are very attentive during the times I've visited. A popular place when there's conventions going on in the area - so lunch time it's usually full with people.  Highly suggest trying this out if you're around seaport

Name: Real Deal, LLC; Review: Covid helpful info: parallel street parking, no meters. Most times of the day you can find a spot near this location. Once you walk into the joint you will go to the cashier to get your food. They have 2-3 tables inside but not sure if you can dine in there. No tables to dine out, it is mostly a location people do take out or delivery from.  This location is a local favorite for me. I used to live near the Cleveland Circle location, hang out with friends near the JP one, and now I live by the West Roxbury location and I love them all equally. Their food is consistent and they are always quick. My favorite app that I get almost every time is their onion rings because they are really yummy but I am a big fan of sauces and their kickin bayou sauce is delicious! The sauce is like a sriracha, Mayo, and other yummy things (real deal sorry if I’m wrong with those ingredients!) Meals I typically get are the Joe Spa (chicken Caesar wrap), Reuben, grown up grilled cheese, any burger, and any pizza. Definitely would recommend going to any of their locations"
Brazilian churrasco spots,"Name: Brazilian Steak Grill; Review: I recently moved to Marlborough, and have been checking out some of the many Brazilian restaurants in the area. When I came to this nondescript place last week, I was skeptical at first, but it had several 5-star reviews. I'm now eager to add my own.  This is one of those places that doesn't need any frills or fancy signs because they have great service and excellent food. The buffet provides a good assortment of side items: vegetables, beans, rice, etc. But, the main draw of a Brazilian place is the meat, and theirs is heaven. I tried pork sausage, short ribs, and two different kinds of steak. Each bite was a treasure.  You may pay a little more than at other places, but you won't taste anything better than what you find here. I've found my new favorite restaurant
Name: Brazilian Steak Grill; Review: This Experience was Unique!  Please read and share in the joy. When we decide to visit a restaurant we take a chance hoping the experience will be positive. My Fiancee and I are very adventurous and in fact it was I who chose Brazilian Steak Grill this time.  I am a resident of Marlborough and one day coming back from Home Depot I saw this restaurant but never stopped in. I knew it was there but never stopped in. This time it was different altogether.  As a Baby, I was given up for adoption back in 1963. I never knew my biological parents and I never knew if I had brothers or sisters. It so happens that I did a DNA test and I started to reconnect with cousins BUT in the process I found my long lost sister.  My Sisters name is Almitra, her husband Brent bought her a wedding anniversary gift, a trip to meet the brother she never knew she had. So we got together, we met and I decided to bring us to Brazilian Steak Grill Restaurant.  We entered the restaurant and were received warmly by the owner himself. The wonderful thing was that he took the time to explain all of the ingredients in his buffet display. Americans don't know much about Brazilian Cuisine but he gave us a crash course. He explained the different types of grilled steak, pork, chicken, sausage and more.  The owner made us feel welcome, important, valued and appreciated. In fact he made us feel like family. I later explained how symbolic the visit was to me, my sister and my family for being there.  Long story short. This is a wonderful establishment to eat at. The staff is friendly, the food is fresh and well cooked and you can taste the Brazilian Love and Hospitality.  We are extremely grateful to him, his staff and the Love we felt going there.  Come and enjoy our experience. A feeling of Family coming together.  Muinto Obrigado Gente. Deus t Abençoe abundantemente.  Enjoy Brazil on a plate
Name: Brazilian Steak Grill; Review: It is the best Brazilian restaurant I have ever gone to so far. It is family owned, the food is delicious with no preservatives, there are lots of varieties including vegetables/salads, some of which are very healthy, and the meat is very tender and juicy. The staff is very friendly, warm, and courteous, and the service is outstanding. When my husband and I came in, we were greeted by a very nice young lady, Carole, and Ed, the owner, also greeted us and brought us a complimentary and delicious dessert (Pudim/flan) when we were done eating. We actually found out from him that the food is home made and there are no preservatives added. When it comes to the price, it is very reasonable and affordable. I highly recommend Brazilian Steak Grill and I would give this place more than 5 stars if I could
Name: Boston Kitchen Inc; Review: One of my favorite spots to grab something to eat. fantastic location, neat, and excellent service. Keep it up
Name: Taco Mex Restaurant; Review: The food was good the first time I was in this place on a Wednesday I asked for exactly the same churrasco well done but unfortunately it’s very burnet I deduce that it is Saturday there is more movement but the eagerness does not mean quality the truth was not I wanted to return because unfortunately I saw one of the girls cleaning her nose and she only turned her mask to the position and did not wash her hands or sanitizer anything with this situation we are experiencing and the minimum is to have clean hands and more working with the public was terribl","Name: Brazilian Steak Grill; Review: We try to get to this Brazilian Steak Grill  every weekend its so good!!!   The salad and side bar with it's different dishes is a great meal in and of itself but of course you must taste the excellent grilled steak - cooked to perfection!  There is also Braised beef, Bacon wrapped chicken and sausages. And PLEASE don't forget the crispy pork, YUMMY!   You will need to take home an order of the most luscious Flan if you have no more room in your belly, which is normally the case for me

Name: Fogo de Chão Brazilian Steakhouse; Review: Fogo de Chao is, with no hyperbole, the best dining experience I've ever had. As a small town guy, I never knew that a place like this could even exist. I'm sure there are fancier restaurants that people will vouch for, but in terms of the atmosphere, service, and overall experience, I have nothing but good things to say. It all starts with the buffet line, which is full of fresh fruits, salad, vegetables, olives, and tons of other options, all of which made for a good appetizer. Then, you flip your card over to the green side, and Brazilian angels from heaven descend upon your table, offering an endless variety of incredible meats on a silver platter. Bacon-wrapped sirloin, pork sausage, parmesan pork chops, leg of lamb, ribs, bacon-wrapped chicken... it never stops, and the quality ranges from good to mind-blowing. I never thought I would describe a restaurant as fun, but it really is. Deciding when to flip the cards, when to take a break, and trying all sorts of new stuff that you normally wouldn't makes for a very memorable time. It's just so hard to resist everything they offer. I wouldn't be surprised if we ate 10,000 calories between the three of us. The service is also excellent; as soon as I was ready for a new plate, a server swooped in and brought it to me before I even had to ask. They also provide you with a few different sides throughout the meal, like garlic mashed potatoes and caramelized bananas, which are delicious. Even after all that, we couldn't say no to dessert. The molten chocolate cake was just rich enough to be perfect, and the amazingly moist tres leches cake was fantastic, too. I don't think I'll ever forget my first trip to Fogo de Chao. The food is amazing, the service makes you feel like a king, and the overall experience is something you can't get almost anywhere else. I'm in love
Name: Brazilian Steak Grill; Review: Wow! We arrived at 10:30 on a Saturday night hoping to grab some sort.of food before driving home. We were treated to an amazing experience - from the first friendly greeting, to the perfect advice to this exhausted family about what to order, to the gorgeous voice of the woman singing, to the food....oh the food - that was hot, fresh, and delicious despite the late hour, to the invitations to come back soon as we left, it was a surprise meal that we were grateful we didn't miss and we will be back
Name: Labaredas Brazilian BBQ & Bar; Review: Heard about the new ownership and wanted to give the place some support. Very glad I did.  I went on a Wednesday with my fiance and a couple friends from the area. They had a special for $9 burgers, which three of us got, and I was shocked at the size of it (huge). It was fantastic and a lot different than a burger you'd get at your typical dine in restaurant. Could not recommend enough.  My fiance was the outlier and got the Brazilian steak, of which I had some. Immediately wished I had gotten that. Not to say the burger was not amazing (it was), but the taste on the steak had me wanting more. Definitely going to get that the next time I come.  We had brigadeiro for dessert, which the new owner brought over and said was created with his mother's secret recipe. Admittedly, I have never had brigadeiro before but I would absolutely have it again.  Service was great and the beer tap was excellent. They even had Maine Lunch on tap for any beer aficionados.

Name: Raphael's Restaurant; Review: ""Sometimes it can be hit or miss."" (02/10/19) But however in 11 months things changed and in a very good and positive way. The food has been consistently good of late! The jerk here is fantastic moist and savory.  The rice and peas taste really good like great care has been given. The flavor profiles of the dishes are there the food is consistent. morning noon and evening. I'd definitely recommend the food here if you're looking for that Jamaican Caribbean bite
Name: Blue Mountain; Review: I stopped by today and was greeted with friendly customer service. I had read the article of Boston's top Caribbean and ethnic food restaurants and this place came up, and let me tell you.....IT DID NOT disappoint! The food was excellent. (A little more high end then I'm used to) but none the less I enjoyed my items. The food was flavorful and far from flat. The only thing was some of the food items such as the curry chicken and jerk chicken I had a difficult time identifying some of the flavors such as pemento. However the spice was there.(and it was fantastic) To me this resurant lives up to its Blue Mountain name and I'd highly recommend. Thanks Blue Mountain for serving me fine Jamaican cusine!!!!

Name: Jamaica Mi Hungry; Review: I stumbled on this Jamaican restaurant. When 8 stepped in to the place, I just love the deco; Super trendy and clean look.  The place has sufficient indoor seating. Very clean and friendly family run restaurant.  Food is awesome and great value! We ordered Jerk pull pork, goat curry, and coconut shrimp. It was delicious and good value. They have a good variety of side selections such as fried plantain, grilled corn, rice and bean and etc.  I love the fact that they have vegetarian  curry options for our veggie friends.  I will definitely stop by again.. if I am craving for Jamaican food
Name: Country Kitchen; Review: It was good food. Flavorful. Got the jerk chicken plate and A stew chicken plate. Both were good jerk could use more of a kick. A plate comes with your choice of meat rice and cabbage. You can choose small medium or large. The service is slow and not super friendly. The food is good but lukewarm bc it's premade and in metal warmers
Name: Jamaica Mi Hungry; Review: Fantastic Food and Super friendly service!! Pulled pork, jerk chicken, slaw and curried vegetables.. yum yum yum! The spice was slow and beautiful, worked up hotter little by little. (We has a bite of the spicy pork and wow was that spice hot, and soo flavorfully delicious!) The veggies were perfect, the rice and beans the very best I’ve had in JP. Let’s move on to the double friendly behind the counter.. the best!!

A plate comes with your choice of meat rice and cabbage. You can choose small medium or large. The service is slow and not super friendly. The food is good but lukewarm bc it's premade and in metal warmers

Name: Jamaica Mi Hungry; Review: Fantastic Food and Super friendly service!! Pulled pork, jerk chicken, slaw and curried vegetables.. yum yum yum! The spice was slow and beautiful, worked up hotter little by little. (We has a bite of the spicy pork and wow was that spice hot, and soo flavorfully delicious!) The veggies were perfect, the rice and beans the very best I’ve had in JP. Let’s move on to the double friendly behind the counter.. the best!! Thanks for welcoming us so warmly, laughing easily, showing us all the food and feeding us tasters, can’t wait to get back!! Welcome to the neighborhood! You can definitely enjoy seating and eating, buffet service and super casual, order at counter, lots of seating, clean and comfortable

Name: Raphael's Restaurant; Review: I was craving some Jamaican food and this place popped up on google . I now know why! I went in and everything sounded amazing. I was able to get a combo plate of the jerk chicken and oxtails. And omg! This was even better than I remember from Jamaica. I really like that they don't have you pay till the end. That lets me give a fair decision on how small or big I want to tip. And trust me. ..you're gonna wanna give them all your money. Amazing!!","Name: Raphael's Restaurant; Review: ""Sometimes it can be hit or miss."" (02/10/19) But however in 11 months things changed and in a very good and positive way. The food has been consistently good of late! The jerk here is fantastic moist and savory.  The rice and peas taste really good like great care has been given. The flavor profiles of the dishes are there the food is consistent. morning noon and evening. I'd definitely recommend the food here if you're looking for that Jamaican Caribbean bite

Name: Mofongo House Restaurant; Review: Best place ever !! The best place without a doubt. The best Dominican food and the best atmosphere. Excellent!!! If you want to feel at home, you have to visit this place 👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽 Love it 😍

Name: Jamaica Mi Hungry; Review: I stumbled on this Jamaican restaurant. When 8 stepped in to the place, I just love the deco; Super trendy and clean look.  The place has sufficient indoor seating. Very clean and friendly family run restaurant.  Food is awesome and great value! We ordered Jerk pull pork, goat curry, and coconut shrimp. It was delicious and good value. They have a good variety of side selections such as fried plantain, grilled corn, rice and bean and etc.  I love the fact that they have vegetarian  curry options for our veggie friends.  I will definitely stop by again.. if I am craving for Jamaican food

Name: Raphael's Restaurant; Review: OMG!!! The food here is amazingly good.  It's a 10 out of 10.  I have never been disappointed with anything that I've ordered and I've eaten here at least 15 times.  Everything is authentically and deliciously seasoned and extremely flavorful. The deco & service is on the mediocre side but who cares when the food is so exceptional ( especially, in comparison to all the other ""Jamaican/Caribbean"" food spots in a ten mile a radius of this place)!

Name: Philadelphia Steak & Hoagie; Review: Don’t TRY!! Steak were so dry like jerkies, and there is like only one slice of cheese in a “CHEESE” steak ! Guess I’ll have to go to Philadelphia for the real cheese steak"
Tapas bars in the area,"Name: Bin 26 Enoteca; Review: We went here on a recommendation. We thought by looking at the menu outside, the prices were reasonable. Once seated, the waiter informed us the menu is tapas style. Unless we missed this, there was no mention outside of this restaurant serving tapas style.  The food itself was average. The garden salad was just a mix of greens and my ricotta gnocchi in cream sauce was fair. Bread and oil are served with your meal.  On a positive note, the staff (host and servers) were very welcoming and friendly. The wine we had was great and the selection of wines were plentiful
Name: La Casa de Pedro Rapido; Review: This place is overpriced and just okay. At $18.50, My husband's lunch Cubano was tasty and large enough to save half for a later meal, so not too bad. But I ordered a $14.50 lunch portion salad with chicken and avocado and only got 3 tiny slices of avocado - less than 1/8 of an avocado. The chicken was more generous and tasted good, but I found a small bone. But my biggest complaint is definitely the prices. They had a tapas and ceviche menu that we didn't dare order from because the tapas start at ~$10 each and the ceviches start at ~$15 each, and we were advised each person should order 2-3 items. Rip off. The entree menu was also overpriced. There also was no pre-meal snacks like chips or salsa like you would typically have at Latin inspired restaurants. I don't expect this restaurant to last long in the area
Name: Porto; Review: While many restaurants are small in this area, and impossible to get a table, Porto is crowded and busy, but there were tables/bar options when I went and the staff worked to accomodate my group. The tapas style is more unique than traditional courses, but it did encourage sharing and they have options that include meat, vegetables, and fresh seafood, to please your entire group.  The flavors are recognizable but with little well-curated notes of citrus, nuts, or hot pepper. I was a big fan of their lobster wrap and their scallop ceviche; my fiance does not eat scallops and yet loved this. Service was quick, even for the entire branzino that was ordered. The only issue I had is that my octopus was chewy. Across over 10 different tapas/entrees, everything else was superb along with the service and my cocktail. Do note, this restaurant is on the pricier side as my friend exclaimed later, ""$9 for a lampchop?!?!?,"" but I found it worth the price
Name: La Catrina - Mexican Food; Review: This place always surpasses my expectations. Recently, I brought guests from out of town to a tapas place nearby here. In the past two weeks, the tapas place apparently got new management and a lot has changed. Needless to say, we left that restaurant dissatisfied and still hungry. We were looking for something to fill this void, and saw a “Taco Tuesday” sign outside of La Catrina and said “why not?” We not only received great food and drinks, but also great service for such a packed restaurant. The waitress even went to 7-Eleven when they ran out of Sprite for a mixed drink we ordered. Also, we got guacamole to go which tasted fresh and delicious. This whole meal hit the spot after such an anticlimactic and underwhelming dining experience  from the other restaurant close by. I love this place and always forget how great it is. Will be going back very soon
Name: Society on High; Review: There's some identity confusion going in here. Tapas, but not necessarily Spanish influenced. The dumplings we're deep fried, not pan fried (yes I said dumplings in the sentence after tapas). The lamb chops okay, overcooked to be honest. Got one chip and one end piece...wawaeaaa. good oysters, foie gras was good, roasted brussel sprouts were undercooked, blackened on the cut face only, slimy on the shell.... Service, great. Great attention to us. Good atmosphere. A lot going for this place, get your consistency back. Those plates were probably not served the way they were intended","Name: Tapeo; Review: Tapeo never changes. Tapeo, never change. This high volume tapas bar has every item on the menu that they had 15 years ago. None of them have changed, and that's just fine, because they're all perfect little versions of classic Spanish tapas dishes. Yes, there is a frequently changing list of tapas specials, and they are often very good, but it is so difficult to pull myself away from ordering my old standbys -- shrimp in garlic, scallops in garlic cream sauce, pork loin with goat cheese, tortilla espanola (the cold potato and egg staple dish of Spain), and chicken croquettes almost inevitably find their way to my table over the course of an evening there. On most nights, for many hours, tapas are half off at the bar, and the sangria -- which flows from a tap -- is one of the best examples of this often cloying concoction. Copper accents ensure Tapeo is never quiet, even when (rarely) empty, but the environment feels intimate nonetheless
Name: Tapeo; Review: I love this place - eat at the bar for cheaper prices!  I went here 10 years ago and fell in love with the place. I take my friends there whenever we travel to Boston and they love it as well. Although its not that same as 10 years ago I still love it.  We usually eat at the bar and get several of the $5 and $7 tapas plates and a pitcher of Sangria (usually more than one). Beware the sangria is strong (which is why I like it). The staff is always nice and actually speak spanish. Note that there are only about 12 or so seats at the bar so you may need to eat at the tables and pay full-price
Name: Barcelona Wine Bar; Review: Having been to Spain a couple times and dined at a number of tapas and paella restaurants there, I can say that Barcelona Wine Bar is pretty authentic. My boyfriend and I came at 9pm on Sunday, and true to the Spanish custom of dining late, dinner was still bustling. Unfortunately, some dishes, like the octopus, were sold out, but mostly we were able to get what we wanted.  Charcuterie platter: We got a soft goat cheese, salami, and jamón serrano. All were delightful. The meats has just the right amount of fat and weren't overwhelmingly salty, and the cheese had a nice touch of tangyness and goatyness.  Paella de mariscos: We shared a paella for one between the two of us, and it was more than enough. The rice was a little hard and crunchy with ample wetness, which I liked. There were lots of onions and peppers in the dish though, which may or may not be to your liking.  Crispy beef tendon: Interesting but wouldn't order again. Wasn't that flavorful.  Duck confit salad: I just wanted some greens to balance the meal out, and this salad did the trick.  Albondigas (meatballs): Amazing! Juicy and full of tomato flavor. Loved the chunky ham and tomato sauce. Couldn't tell whether the stringy bits inside the meatballs were cheese, and as a lactose intolerant person, I'd rather not know.  Wine: I really enjoyed my Zarel-lo white wine.  Bread: Amazing. Probably one of the best parts of the meal. Warm, crunchy crust, soft and moist interior. Would buy this bread if they sold it.  The service was a bit flustered. Wasn't a huge fan of the waiter mansplaining tapas to me, and the server who poured our wine didn't give us a taste before pouring the glass. We also had to ask several times for oil for the bread
Name: Estragon Tapas; Review: Smell is principal to taste. When the smoked paprika - sweet, caressing, warmth - hits your nose it's a done deal: one relaxes into the feast of small plates delivering the biggest of flavors. The shishito peppers are just better here because (freshness?), (the evoo?), (the smoky element?), (the flaked flor de sal?). I'm a fan of morcilla as Boston's Puerto Rican community introduced me to it. Here at Estragón, they do it quite to my liking: some heat and crispy where it should be.  I prefer croquetas de bacalao to be more clearly, declaratively fishy-salt-cod than the creamy offering here. On the positive side, their crunch was perfect as was the crispness of the patátas bravas.  When chef/owner, Julio de Haro, carves Jamón Ibérico de Bellota from the ham holder and regales in his childhood stories of food, love, and technique, that meat-butter, served at the perfect temperature, melts in your mouth better, tastes better, is a more complete sensual experience.  I like tapas here more than anywhere else. I'm glad it's not a ""scene""... yet..
Name: Taproom Bar & Grill; Review: Really fun spot, close to our house.  There is a cute patio outside with several tables gorgeous hanging baskets and music. Some nights they have live music, and the interior of the bar is really nice. There is a dining area and they have these really unique doors that roll up and open up to make it an open air bar. A few dogs even visited and were enthusiastically loved upon by several patrons. Cozy and hip at the same time","Name: Tapeo; Review: Tapeo never changes. Tapeo, never change.

Every single tapa was delicious and not teeny tiny like another tapas place that starts with a B 😳Drinks were superb and crafted. Service was chill and speedy.  I’m hesitant to write this review because I want to be a secret Boston gem 😏  We ate: • the ceviche with passion fruit (the flavor depth is insane) • patatas bravas (amazing sauce) • elote (nommmm) • drinks on drinks  Keep doing what y’all are doing

Name: El Morro Restaurant; Review: Service was amazing! Raquel explained the menu to my non Spanish speaking friends and they were delighted with her service. The food was very tasteful. The prices were on point for a restaurant setting. The atmosphere was great...the music incredibly great!!! This is not a quick take out place this is an actual restaurant that is open till 1am. This restaurant was very much needed. I will definitely go back & recommend this place

Turkish kebab restaurants,"Name: Ali Baba Restaurant Boston; Review: Good authentic Turkish spot.  They speak English, but Turkish is their first language, and the food reflects it... delicious!  I had the Turlu (vegetable stew) $9, comes with Bulghur (rice), Ayran (yoghurt drink) $3 and bread (complimentary). All delicious.  Followed up with Turkish Tea ($2), and that was good as well. Total bill was 14.98 before tip, brought it to $15 with the tip (jk, I tip).  Bathroom is clean, nice floor, and some art work, but you have to go through the kitchen to get there.  They offer nice desserts (see photos) like baklava, and they make Turkish coffee. The have Splenda for your sugar substitute.  I would probably be a regular if I lived or worked near here.  Thumbs up if you appreciate this review
Name: Turkish Lazuri Café; Review: This gem just opened up in my neighborhood.  The service is amazing, the staff are friendly and welcoming.  The menu (most, maybe all, Halal) has a variety of Turkish, American, and Italian dishes.  They offer a full breakfast menu, appetizers, entrees, sides, and an enticing array of homemade desserts, including THREE different types of, “made fresh, this morning, by Mom”, baklava.  Beverages include Turkish Tea and Turkish coffee.  This place is such a delight.  It has definitely earned a place in our dine in and take-out rotation
Name: Sultan's Kitchen; Review: My boyfriend and I were craving some Turkish food while in Boston. This place hit the spot. Ended up eating here quite a few times during our stay in Boston. They have sarma, great pilaf, and plenty of kebab meats and vegetarian options like eggplant. Reasonably priced. Incredibly delicious. Fast. Casual. Chef is sweet. Also they have a cook book that is really nice
Name: Saray Restaurant‎; Review: I ate here for lunch on a Wednesday afternoon. The restaurant was empty except for one other customer. The restaurant was clean, and presented well for an establishment in this price range.  Service was sub-par, considering it was lunchtime and that the restaurant was not busy. I felt like it was an imposition for me to be dining there.  I ordered the Adana Kebab lunch special. The special came with a choice of hummus or red lentil soup. I chose the hummus which was served as a first course with bread. Both the bread and hummus were decent, but nothing special. The rest of the meal arrived after about ten minutes. The special consisted of a single kebab, a serving of white rice, chopped raw red onions, and a pickled red cabbage. The kebab was hot and flavorful, but the rice was poorly cooked and the picked cabbage was mostly flavorless. Overall, for the total price, $13, the meal was disappointing. The rice, onion, and cabbage were mostly inedible, so the special was really only a single kebab and the hummus.  There are much better options, at least for lunch, in the Packard's Corner area
Name: Sultan's Kitchen; Review: Big fan of Sultan's Kichen - quick, fast, delicious Turkish food in the heart of the Financial District. They're open on Saturdays, which makes for a stellar post-gym lunch. Their menu is endless and includes an array of vegetarian options (at least 10 different veggie mezes) as well as chicken, pork, lamb, and all sorts of meat. If you're in the mood for a home-cooked Turkish meal, this comes pretty close. Two things against Sultan's Kitchen - credit card minimum of $9 and food is a bit overpriced","Name: Gyro and Kebab House; Review: The first time we went specifically to Turkish cuisine. And I liked everything. Food, service, hall. There were few people and the distance was kept. Hot bread with different sauces, lamb kebab with fresh salad, meze. Strong tea is free. The second time there was another shift and everything somehow got worse. There were no more sauces for bread, everything somehow decreased in size. The third time again there was not a lot of things, plus they ordered a lahmajun with them, and unlike the previous time, it also became smaller, they did not put sauces on it and did not cover it with paper. A convenient place, next to the highway, we will be nearby - we will stop, but we will not go on purpose. There is no interest in customers there. Girls are always ""sad"".
Name: Sultan's Kitchen; Review: I would eat here everyday if I could.  Variety abounds, from intensely flavored cold vegetarian salads to the meaty kebabs and specials.  If you are lucky enough to hit an eggplant or stuffed pepper or lamb special, go for it without hesitation.  The eggplant dishes here are buttery, unctuous, rich with flavor and texture. I haven't experienced a better eggplant treatment anywhere. On a frigid arctic day the soups are steaming hot and stews rich and satisfying.  On a Spring or Summer day, get a Kofte or Donner Kebab sandwich wrapped in pita and filled with broiling hot meats and cool Turkish salad with the pita barely holding it all together. There is also this great walk-around pita ""sandwich"" which is great as well
Name: Saray Restaurant‎; Review: First of all, there is nothing special about this place. We went there for a dinner with my family. We ordered lentil  soup and their special kabab (vali kebabi) and shepherd salad. The lentil soup was the worst lentil soup that I have ever eaten in the US. All of the other Turkish  restaurants have better soup than this place. The kabab that we ordered was a mixed one in which there were chicken shish, lamb shish, kufte, Adana kabab and doner. Except the chicken none of them has any taste when I compare it with the kababs that I ate in other Turkish restaurants. With all of these, they are really overpriced and they charged me 13.5 dolar for something that  I really don't know. The guy wrote that number to the receipt by hand and I did not want to say anything because I had a guest with me. I don't think I am going to visit that place again
Name: Café de Boston; Review: It is a very big restaurant with many varieties. You can make your own pasta. You can make your plate from the cold bar (it is 30% off after 2:30). I returned and bought Turkish coffee. Doner kebab was good. Turkish coffee is already the same as in Turkey. A spacious place. It is very easy in transportation. I met an authorized Turkish sister there, but unfortunately I forgot her name now. The room restaurant introduced me and gave information. He said that they keep the website updated in terms of menu every day. They were not open on weekends because their workplaces were closed.
Name: Ali Baba Restaurant Boston; Review: I liked the $5 lahmajun (like a thin crust meat pizza without tomato sauce). Quite honestly, I've had better koobideh/kofte kebabs elsewhere (Los Angeles, Providence, Baltimore, New York).  I did enjoy the chicken kebab and the lamb one was good yet just ordinary.  I thought the adana kebab was undercooked in the center and a bit too salty.  Not sure I would go back based on the food alone.  That said, one annoying thing was the seating.  Because I came in with a party of 10, I asked for 2 tables to split my party, but the hostess kept saying no (even though there were 2 empty tables) so I asked if half my party could get seated while the other half could wait for another open table and she still said no.  In the end, they took 2 smaller parties that walked in after us with no reservations in place (a party of 3 in a 6 person table and a party of 2 in a 4 person table).

You can make your plate from the cold bar (it is 30% off after 2:30). I returned and bought Turkish coffee. Doner kebab was good. Turkish coffee is already the same as in Turkey. A spacious place. It is very easy in transportation. I met an authorized Turkish sister there, but unfortunately I forgot her name now. The room restaurant introduced me and gave information. He said that they keep the website updated in terms of menu every day. They were not open on weekends because their workplaces were closed.

Name: Turkish Lazuri Café; Review: Just had the best experience! They have a large menu but do everything really well! The service is great, the Pide/Kebap/Soups were all delicious, & the dessert was out of this world.  I really recommend the Pide & the Börek pastries. The Turkish Tea/Coffees were perfect as well

Name: Sultan's Kitchen; Review: My boyfriend and I were craving some Turkish food while in Boston. This place hit the spot. Ended up eating here quite a few times during our stay in Boston. They have sarma, great pilaf, and plenty of kebab meats and vegetarian options like eggplant. Reasonably priced. Incredibly delicious. Fast. Casual. Chef is sweet. Also they have a cook book that is really nice

Name: Uptowne Mediterranean Restaurant; Review: I found out Uptowne Mediterranean Restaurant by accident. I was shopping in the plaza where it's located and it was lunch time so I wanted to give it a shot. They have great food for really great prices. The chicken and meat shawerma is as fresh as it can be. They cut it off the big rotating skewer and make your meal. The kebabs, appetizers, salads and fixing all are authentic Mediterranean recipes. Lots of Vegetarian choices as well. Falafel, Spinach pie etc. It's a family run business and everyone helping each other and the customers. I started also using them to cater for our company lunches. They make big platters also can make sandwiches. It's the best thing I discovered which reminds me of home. Thanks for your time reading this review

Name: Ali Baba Restaurant Boston; Review: I liked the $5 lahmajun (like a thin crust meat pizza without tomato sauce). Quite honestly, I've had better koobideh/kofte kebabs elsewhere (Los Angeles, Providence, Baltimore, New York).  I did enjoy the chicken kebab and the lamb one was good yet just ordinary.  I thought the adana kebab was undercooked in the center and a bit too salty.  Not sure I would go back based on the food alone.  That said, one annoying thing was the seating.  Because I came in with a party of 10, I asked for 2 tables to split my party, but the hostess kept saying no (even though there were 2 empty tables) so I asked if half my party could get seated while the other half could wait for another open table and she still said no.  In the end, they took 2 smaller parties that walked in after us with no reservations in place (a party of 3 in a 6 person table and a party of 2 in a 4 person table). So that was really mystifying and annoying"
Sushi burrito places nearby,"Name: Herrera's Mexican Grill; Review: Went in today and purchased the super grilled chicken burrito. Filled me up because of the rice and beans in it but the burrito only had 2 small pieces of chicken in it. What the hell man if I'm paying damn near $10 for a burrito at least load it up with chicken hence the name ""chicken burrito ""

Name: Currito; Review: Ordered the tika burrito, regular size with grilled chicken.  There was little tika sauce in the burrito, if any. I thought, no big deal, they must've just forgotten. So I asked for more sauce and the lady behind the counter gave me attitude and begrudgingly gave me a tiny amount of sauce in a small plastic dish. Well, the burrito is pretty large and if you ever order tika masala at an Indian restaurant, the chicken is drenched in sauce. The minuscule amount of sauce I was given in addition to the zero sauce that was in my regular size burrito was not enough to give the burrito a cohesive taste. So, I asked for more sauce.  The lady then gave me attitude and told me that if I wanted more sauce I had to pay for it. I told her that I didn't even get any sauce in the first place, but she said I still have to pay more.  I did not want to pay for more sauce out of principle and the rest of my burrito went in the trash.  Overall, I had terrible experience due to: 1. Not enough sauce in burrito. Inedible without it. 2. Bad service that gives attitude to customers 3. Rice in burrito was extremely mushy and clumped together
Name: Basho Sushi; Review: Good sushi good price","Name: New Sushi Inc; Review: Went here for a quick ""grab n'go"" bite to eat. The shrimp tempura burrito was absolutely delicious! It's a really big portion for the price. The poke bowl was so-so, smaller than the usual for the same price as larger bowls. The location can be a bit confusing and crowded since it's a single building with 3 restaurants side by side, no dividing walls so seating is limited- on a beautiful day take a walk and sit outside instead
Name: New Sushi Inc; Review: Kind of a build your own Sushi Bowl place. I think Chipotle, but with sushi. Fish was fresh, sauces were delicious, and my order was accurate. I ordered online, and the pickup was seamless. There's not much seating in the restaurant itself, it shares a spot with a defunct Dunkin Donuts and a sub shop. Definitely not a place you'd want to go if you want to sit down and have a meal, but it's excellent if you want a quick little lunch on your break at work. I'm glad I found it! Definitely get the crispy garlic on top
Name: Kappo Sushi and Ramen; Review: Tried their sushi burrito. Very fresh ingredients with salmon, tuna, tobiko eggs, and a mixed slaw that all worked very well together. Miso soup was delicious as well! Will be back to try out their ramen. Side note: this place is being run by the same people behind Ebi Sushi (Union Sq) and Hokkaido Ramen (Central Sq), so you can have high expectations for food quality
Name: Mexicali Sushi Bar; Review: I would recommend this place to anyone who hasn’t had the pleasure of enjoying Mexican sushi. Mexican sushi is pretty much cooked steak, chicken, and/or shrimp rolled in a rice roll. It can be fried or not fried. The practice started somewhere in Mexico (Sinaloa last I heard) and gained popularity on the west coast ie California. This place is nice and the food is good. I would recommend to the owner to tone down the amount of rice as it did feel like there was too much rice and not enough meat. I would also recommend the owner get an alcohol license because that will bring in a lot more cash to the business. And drinking a corona or modelo with this food is the perfect combo. Other than that, this place is awesome and the owner is super friendly and attentive to your experience at the Mexican sushi bar. :
Name: Sunny Cafe; Review: First place I had a sushi burrito and was not dissapointed in the slightest. It's as amazing as it sounds.

Love the vegetable caterpillar as well. The prices aren't bad at all, the platter was a very good value. Couldn't have been happier with the consensus.

Ramen noodle bars around here,"Name: Allston Ten Second Noodles 十秒到云南米线; Review: Loved the noodles and the broth. It will be my go to place for ramen (although it is not ramen)
Name: Tora Ramen; Review: Amazing ramen! Had a chance to taste good tonkatsu ramen after a long time. I had the kuro tonkatsu ramen which is very good . Probably better than all ramen places I have tried in Boston. The spicy miso ramen was very good too as told by my partner. Something I had never tried before was torched pork belly that came with the ramen and it was melt in mouth. we also ordered a side of kuro karaage which was very crunchy yet moist . Cash only and they accept tips with it

Name: Tao Ramen•Sushi; Review: First time here and I’m definitely coming back. I moved here from Boston and this place is one of the best ramen place I’ve seen so far. Now I don’t have to drive to Boston to get my ramen fix
Name: Tora Ramen; Review: I was here for the soft opening and was pleasantly surprised. I got the shiro ramen with double chashu ramen that was cooked perfectly via the sous vide. Very yummy broth and one of the best soft boiled eggs I’ve had in a long time. Totto ramen comes in a close second. You’ll find me here more often as I plan to try all the different kinds of ramen they offer","Name: Wen's noodle and Ramen 过桥米线; Review: I usually get orders to go, but some times dine in.

Name: Noodle Lab; Review: I’m not always at boston, but when I am, I drop by Haymarket. I always get a smoothie to start my long day but one point I am starving. Decided to give this place a try, didn’t disappoint me. Love how they have the create your own menu thing which makes the process faster, I guess. Genius.  I love ramen, so a quick, easy grab one is just heaven for me. I took a ramen+ricebowl combo. For ramen, I took tonkatsu broth, which was just fabulous, taste wise i’d give it 4, but the noodles, a 5. It was not mushy, not too solid, rice was good too.  If I live in boston, i’d probably eat lunch here everyday ☺
Name: Amateras Ramen; Review: First, most remarkable was how fast and efficient the service was during Friday lunch hour. Second, don't be put off by the construction outside, I walked past it once before I saw it the second time. Third, this is the first ramen I've tried outside of Chicago that has deighted me as much as my favorite ramen shops in Chi Town (obviously I've never been to Japan).  For the purpose of true comparison I kept it simple: Yokohama Tonkatsu and Pakchee Salad. The broth was rich and complex, just as it should be. The pork was tender. If I were to do it over I would have ordered some extra toppings. Size wise this was a little smaller than I'm used to but I still couldn't finish all the noodles. And the Cold Brew Iced Matcha Green Tea was a nice suprise as I ordered it without looking at the menu and thought I was just getting green tea. They served it with simple syrup on the side but I didn't need it
Name: Amateras Ramen; Review: The only times I've gone here is at night. They have very fast, attentive, and polite service, but I have never been during a busy time.  The ramen is good. It reminds me of the ramen shops in Japan. Their Yokohama tonkotsu ramen isn't as creamy as the tonkotsu you'll get in a nice shop in Tokyo (what most people think of when they think tonkotsu), but I like it.  They have a few other types, including spicy miso with different levels of spiciness (on the ""specials"" menu).  The menu is very concise and simple. Each ramen type comes with basic toppings, and you can add in as many toppings as you like for an extra $1-$4 each. I like their varied selection of toppings.  I hope this place doesn't make me fat
Name: Oisa Ramen; Review: This is my third time here, and I gotta say there’s something about the “coziness” that I really enjoy. So far, loving the tonkotsu and the beef one (the nezi shoyu? Shabuyaki? sorry, I don’t remember the name). The truffle one was a little too “sweet” for me, but certainly a unique ramen... I’ve never had something quite like it!  Ok, so now let’s talk a little bit about the triangle of ramen classification . On the corners of this triangle are: modern, comfort, and experimental. In Boston, you can think of experimental as ‘Yume wo katare’. I’m not sure if there’s a modern one here, but if you’re a ramen fan you’ll know of Ippudo (there’s one in New York), which is a solid modern on the classification scale. And lastly there’s comfort. And you can think of comfort as a hearty bowl of ramen that’ll fill you up and keep you warm on a cold winter day.  This place sits real close to modern, with a slight bias towards comfort, and just a scooch towards experimental. What does this mean for you? I have no idea.

Name: Pikaichi; Review: Wow! What a nice surprise to have a Ramen shop just down the street from my work place! And even more, it's Pikaichi!!! I have visited it's previous Allston Super 88 location before a few times, and was sad that it had closed. I was also sad that my favorite Burrito place that used to be here closed recently, wondering what would come here next. Then one day, I noticed the familiar ""Lightning bolt"" Pikaichi sign in the window of this location. Really?! And finally this week, it has opened, and the wait is over! Hurray! Came to check things out on lunch today. Nice & clean, obviously brand new interior, of a familiar location to me. Seats were mostly full, but the wait time should be short. Ordered Pikaichi Miso Ramen. The Ramen noodles were my favorite thick 'Futo-men', and nicely cooked chewy. Miso base soup/broth was VERY tasty as well. A few slices of very tender and also tasty Chashu pork, and corn on the top. You can also add many different topping as well, if you like. I need to come here again to try out all the other flavors. Congratulations on re-opening here in West Medford! I will definitely be back for more

Name: Snappy Sushi; Review: Ordered a miso ramen and rainbow barertta (8pcs) for about 13 each entree on a Saturday evening. I am ambivalent about the sushi because the quality of the fish was average and it was made with slightly overdone brown rice (didn't see it mentioned that it would be brown rice in the menu). The ramen was nicely seasoned with two slices of chicken but the noodles just didn't meet my expectations. The noodles actually reminded me of the yellow lo mein noodles that they use in Chinese restaurants... Atmosphere was cozy and service was prompt. It wasn't too crowded only a few other tables. The price was reasonable, service was polite and prompt but food was average and sort of disappointing so I will give it 3/5 for average because with all the quality and varied choices available in Boston..there is just no attraction in revisiting

However, I went to Chili Duck and the first time I ordered Drunken Noodles which were good but my friend had the Pad Thai and it was out of this world good. Now every time I go I get the pad thai, chicken satay, and extra peanut sauce (which is also better than almost anywhere else I've been). The place is decent sized, I've never had to wait and they are good about call in take out orders. It's definitely my new favorite Thai plac
Name: Rod Thai Family Taste; Review: I love their pad thai, tom yum soup, basil fried rice, spicy crispy chicken, pad paradise, and thai iced tea. Their service is quick, food is delicious/comforting, and it's always a go-to dinner whenever I don't feel like cooking. Prior to COVID-19, I loved their outdoor seating area, and how they would always bring the food out to you if you were eating there :) I've been to other thai places in Boston and I honestly travel to go to Rod Thai because the other places just don't compare
Name: Kala Thai Cookery; Review: Kala has been my go-to Thai place since my friends recommended it to me. I've desperately missed decent Thai food and this really hits the spot! Honestly, every dish I've had here is just amazing - curries, fried rice, pad thai (I don't even like pad thai), soup, see ew, char kway teow. Oh man, all of it is super mouth watering! I typically order for pickup or delivery, but definitely could eat there as well. It's a small location but it's cute and everyone is very friendly. Please, do yourself a favor and get food from here
Name: Wonder Spice Cafe; Review: We went one night, and loved it so much we came back again the next night. We both got the Southern Pad Thai the first night. It was pad thai made with curry spices, and it was amazing. The second night I got the normal pad thai, it was a bit under flavored, at least in comparison to the southern pad thai, but still good
Name: Spice & Pepper; Review: This place has the best Thai food around.  I pass three other Thai restaurants on my fifteen minute drive to get there and well worth it.

Name: Thai Dish; Review: I stopped at Thai Dish for lunch today.  Very small place just off  Commonwealth Avenue. Extensive menu, you order at the counter for sit-down or take-out.  I ate by the window (I was the only customer at that hour)  I began with a generous bowl of the Tom Kha Gai Soup, slices of chicken with mushrooms in light coconut milk flavored with galangal, chilies and lime $4.25.  The unique flavors of the galanga and lime combined with the slightly sweet coconut milk make this soup one of my favorites.  Then I had the Pickpow bowl with choice of meat (my choice a chicken) slightly spicy, delicious sautéed with chili sauce with  mushrooms, carrots,  red peppers, scallions, and baby corn. $10.  Served with a huge bowl of white rice.  The portion as large and I took half home.  The food was so good I wanted to try their Chicken Pad Thai.  I took one order to go. Rice noodles stir fried with tamarind sauce, fish sauce, egg scallion. $9.25  The place is immaculate, the staff very friendly and accommodating.

Name: Ba Lẹ Restaurant; Review: Just picked up Tonight's dinner and it was delicious! When I walked up to the door there was a sign stating that no more than 10 people were allowed in the shop at a time. A quicklook through thedoor and it was easy to see that there were at least 14 patrons lined up. With signs requesting 6 ft of social distance, the message was not being heeded well. I waited outside until a few parties exited.  Immediately upon entering your eyes land table that runs the entire length of the shop. It is covered by an amazing array of jewel-colored treats and sweets. From bean cake to durian cake and platters of multi-colored foods - crispy, salty, scrumptious! A chiller full of ready made beverages, packaged meats and puddings allow you to shop while waiting in the takeout line. Bread and pastries are the first on the prepared food line. Next are small prepared foods, like fresh rolls, Bánh cuốn (flat rice noodles wrapped around scant meaty filling), chả lụa (Vietnamese pork sausage), and steamed cabbage. Finally you reach ""the show"" - the banh mi sandwich moment! Be prepared to choose your filling first _ tofu, bbq beef, or supreme special (cold cuts galore). The bread was sublime! The toppings and sauces perfectly balanced one another. Fast, reasonable, friendly and yummy
Name: Lanta Asian Cuisine; Review: I work a few blocks from here, and popped in looking for a break from the usual lunch options.   Opted to start with a layup to test them out, and got hot basil chicken (comes with rice - which was good sticky rice - legit).  Dish was freshly prepared with fresh ingredients, had great flavor and spice, and was generously sized (but not piggish).   Also grabbed some spring rolls, which were freshly fried up when i ordered them.  Main dish was excellent.  Had genuine Thai flavor, was well prepared and delicious.   Spring rolls were the little guys, 6 to an order, and were hot and delicious.   I'm honestly not sure if these were frozen or homeade (I'm no expert) but they were very good, and the veggies inside were very firm and fresh tasting.   I (embarrassingly) ate all 6.  Only negatives would be atmosphere and price.  It's not polished (but it's not dirty or grimy either).  There's a few simple tables to eat at, but this place is clearly tee'd up for take-out.  Hot Basil Chicken was $9, and the spring rolls were $6.  Food trucks, while not serving up this quality, have much better bargains.  Highly recommend, particularly for takeout","Name: Thai Dish; Review: I stopped at Thai Dish for lunch today.  Very small place just off  Commonwealth Avenue.

I waited outside until a few parties exited.  Immediately upon entering your eyes land table that runs the entire length of the shop. It is covered by an amazing array of jewel-colored treats and sweets. From bean cake to durian cake and platters of multi-colored foods - crispy, salty, scrumptious! A chiller full of ready made beverages, packaged meats and puddings allow you to shop while waiting in the takeout line. Bread and pastries are the first on the prepared food line. Next are small prepared foods, like fresh rolls, Bánh cuốn (flat rice noodles wrapped around scant meaty filling), chả lụa (Vietnamese pork sausage), and steamed cabbage. Finally you reach ""the show"" - the banh mi sandwich moment! Be prepared to choose your filling first _ tofu, bbq beef, or supreme special (cold cuts galore). The bread was sublime! The toppings and sauces perfectly balanced one another. Fast, reasonable, friendly and yummy

Name: Lanta Asian Cuisine; Review: I work a few blocks from here, and popped in looking for a break from the usual lunch options.   Opted to start with a layup to test them out, and got hot basil chicken (comes with rice - which was good sticky rice - legit).  Dish was freshly prepared with fresh ingredients, had great flavor and spice, and was generously sized (but not piggish).   Also grabbed some spring rolls, which were freshly fried up when i ordered them.  Main dish was excellent.  Had genuine Thai flavor, was well prepared and delicious.   Spring rolls were the little guys, 6 to an order, and were hot and delicious.   I'm honestly not sure if these were frozen or homeade (I'm no expert) but they were very good, and the veggies inside were very firm and fresh tasting.   I (embarrassingly) ate all 6.  Only negatives would be atmosphere and price.  It's not polished (but it's not dirty or grimy either).  There's a few simple tables to eat at, but this place is clearly tee'd up for take-out.  Hot Basil Chicken was $9, and the spring rolls were $6.  Food trucks, while not serving up this quality, have much better bargains.  Highly recommend, particularly for takeout

Name: Thai Place; Review: My favorite spot for truly authentic Thai food. They even have Thai menu! If you're Asian or just really well informed of what northern Thai food is all about, and also if you have a strong passion for street-style papaya salad, this is the place to go! Never gonna be disappointed They offer up to 6 different papaya salad styles; Thai, Laotian, etc. The spicy soups are to die for! Variety of Yum dishes. And the service is super good!  Down falls would be that they don't have good, or any Thai dessert. (Except sticky rice mango, which was very bland) Don't get the ice cream here","Name: Thai Place; Review: My favorite spot for truly authentic Thai food. They even have Thai menu!

Name: Asian Garden Restaurant; Review: i don't go as much as my family friends, but when i go, never get disappointed. seafood is always fresh, other dishes fantastics as well, their ""salt & (spicy) pepper"" varieties are raved about. table service varies depending who you get, but the boss is always very courteous and soft-spoken.  appreciates that they serve a sort of Hong Kong style meals - limited variety, but one and only I've seen in Boston.  casual dinner sets available, pick 3 dishes from their list of items for $29.95, or 4 for $39.95. high-roller sets also available, if you go 6 people and up. but I'd usually stick with a la carte, some freshly prepared seafood and a couple other things.  dining room seats are as tight as the bathroom space, though they may have a second level that I've never been.... (?) street parking only, so prepare to walk as the street right outside is always filled up. don't risk double parking to pick up food or what not either, I would not risk it

Name: Thai Place; Review: Love this place. Good quality Thai food at very reasonable prices. It's not the most authentic Thai I've had, but the flavours are wonderful, the ""spicy"" sauces are actually spicy, and everything comes out piping hot and in generous portions. My favourite dishes are the spicy noodles and the appetizers (beef satay, mussels, butterfly shrimp, crab rangoons). The servers are efficient and friendly but don't push things (like specials) on you, unlike at a lot of American restaurants. The drinks are very affordable as well and they have a great casual bar area. My husband and I have been going to the Racha Thai restaurants for years and this is by far our favourite one

Name: Beantown Pho & Grill; Review: I have been here twice, but maybe I will drop by there again.  Located both downstairs and on a terrace, this restaurant offers both Thai and Vietnamese food. I sat on both down inside and outside sitting, and in both places service was good and fast. Downstairs the rest  Thai iced tea is a perfect option for summer as it's very refreshing and good. They have spicy food, so take a look into the menu and look for the spicy dishes. The menu has both lunch and dinner pricing, so if you want to save some bucks you should come on lunch time.  I tried Tom Yum Pad Thai and chicken Panang Curry, both were awesome, tasty and spicy. Also the crunchy rolls and the banana dessert were really good and worth to try. The staff is really paying attention to every customer, refilling their glasses or asking if something is missing or wrong.  I haven't tried Pho dishes, so maybe next time I will give them a try

Name: Thai Dish; Review: Love it. Small mom and pop thai place with great prices and for my money, best thai food in the area. Brown Sugar right around the corner is not only worse tasting, but more expensive.  The more I eat here, the more I am pleased. Excellent curries, soups (love it with a little sour and spice), duck fried rice and drunken noodle. Plus the mango sticky rice dessert was outstanding.  Service in the summer here has been excellent, I'm a man in need of many water refills and they provide. The best part is definitely the taste of the food"
Italian gelato places nearby,"Name: Eataly Boston; Review: Eataly is a wonderful combination of a grocery store, grab-and-go food options, and sit-down dining. I like different aspects of Eataly more than others, but can definitely say that coming here is an experience in itself and it always has be coming back to explore more.  There are different show areas to see how either bread is baked, gelato is made, meat is aged, and fresh pasta is churned out. Super fun and educational. Eataly is a great place to grab some fresh pasta, tomato sauce, greens, dessert, and wine to complete your own DIY Italian date night at home. Definitely something I would try!  Where I've been:  LA PANETTERIA: This is the baked breads and pizza counter. They always have free samples of their bread. One of my favorites is this round loaf of potato bread with oregano. Best eaten fresh on the day of purchase, as with all their breads. I would not recommend the bread with prosciutto and cheese baked inside- while it sounds delectable, it lacked flavor and was not good after 1-2 days. The attached pizza counter serves up a variety of different slices on focaccia and uses super fresh, delicious ingredients. I would highly recommend grabbing a quick bite to eat from here.  IL GELATO: Solid place to get gelato and sorbetto. They make it fresh in house with local milk and imported ingredients. I would definitely recommend pistachio and coconut. My friend said the tiramisu and caffe were too sweet for her liking and was unable to finish it.  IL PESCE: This is one of the few sit-down dining places that sits first come, first serve, no reservations. It's specialty is seafood and I like that there's some focus on fishing responsibly and seasonally. It's a slight step up from your average Italian restaurant chain but definitely not something better than what you find in the North End. I wouldn't recommend this if you've got better places to go, but it's also possible to get a decent meal out of here. I've written more extensively about my experience on its independent Yelp page
Name: Eataly Boston; Review: Visiting Boston with my daughters, one of whom was here for the ASCA school counsellor convention.  My daughters fell in love with Eataly and would go there every day for either gelato or cannoli.  Each time they said their servers were rude.  i went in tonight 15 mins before they closed to look for something sweet other than cannoli or gelato and found some chocolates that I thought I would take back home.  My cashier was nice and weighed my selection and I paid for it.  Cashier did not offer me a receipt.  Walked around the store whilst my daughter  figured out what she wanted to view all their products.  Bought some foccaccia and checked out and my cashier, didn't get her name asked me if I had already paid for the candy to which I said yes.  Asked me  if I had the receipt, to which I said I was not given one.  This cashier was rude.  My daughter got a sample of gelato, some one of the flavor, and she said her server took off her gloves and walked away before she could tell her the flavor she wanted.  Lets say, I am not in a hurry to return to Eataly with such rude employees.  Customer service goes a long way.  I do not usually write reviews but felt the need to, as I feel these cashiers/servers need more training in customer service
Name: La Galleria 33; Review: They need Gordon Ramsey to come back.  When entering the host was wearing a hoodie.  As we walked through the North End we had a concern because all of the restaurants were full and seemed very busy.  Not the case upon our arrival at La Galleria.  There was only 3 or 4 other tables with guests.  The overwhelming smell of this Italian restaurant is not garlic, fresh tomatoes or the essence of fine Italian food being cooked, for example the smells one enjoys while walking by the nearby restaurants.  What do you smell from the open kitchen?  The fryer that smells like old oil, Ugh.  The quality and freshness of the food (muscles, tomatoes on Brushetta, Halibut) was excellent.  However, the preparation was nothing you would go out of your way for.  The burning question would I go back, probably not.  If you are in Boston for only a few days  this is not as expensive as other nearby places the food is OK and you should be able to get a reservation.  If your looking for authentic Italian food, this is not the place.  It is neither romantic or funky.  They had a TV on the wall with a basket ball game and kind of indy rock on the stereo.  It was just really odd and wouldn't want to dine here with friends as it isn't a warm comfortable place even though the exposed brick was warm and welcomin
Name: Coolidge Market; Review: Was skeptical about the outside of the place but a friend told me that the Italian sub is the best. For $4.50 you can get the best Italian sub in the city. It was absolutely delicious, and made with love by a little old woman. 100000% recommend. Although I am sad that no other Italian sandwich will compare
Name: Orfano; Review: Visited for my anniversary this weekend, at the recommendation of a friend.  Everything about this restaurant is stellar. The decor was sleek and intimate, the service was fantastic, and the food was exquisite.  Started with the mozzarella and garlic bread, followed by the cacio e pepe and pasta with squash. Main entree was lamb and lasagna. Finished up with the gelato and chocolate cake.  Everything was cooked to perfection; the handmade pasta and olive oil and salt vanilla gelato were standouts in my opinion. Pasta portions are small, so you will need to order a main to accompany them.  Smaller wine menu, but what they offer is high quality and you should be able to find something that suits you. They offered a great recommendation for my meal that I was very satisfied with.  Service was prompt and attentive. We were never wanting for anything, and left completely satisfied.  Not insanely expensive for what it is; a perfect bit of a splurge for a special event","Name: Eataly Boston; Review: Eataly is a wonderful combination of a grocery store, grab-and-go food options, and sit-down dining.

Name: Babbo Pizzeria e Enoteca; Review: Good food at this Mario Batali landing, but value makes it even better. Pizza Pancetta at $13 (w/crimini and robiola) flirted with the wrong side of a 90-sec, 1000-degree flame, but its charring was miraculously ok, the dough flavorful and, obviously, crisp. A bit more pancetta, please. Pasta alla Norma at $10 (w/tomato, eggplant, basil, ricotta) was fine but the Taccozzette (wide, ribboned) Pasta at $10 (w/spicy sausage, rabe) was better. Gelati at $8 were good, not as good (ie, rich) as in Italy. Pistachio Tarfufo at $10 (w/Valhrona chocolate guanaja, chocolate crumble, sour cherries, zabaglione) was excellent. The Harpoon Irish Stout Coppetta at $10 (w/chocolate gelato, Stout gelato, candied peanuts, cocoa nib brittle, coffee bourbon sauce, peanut crema and the rest of the kitchen sink) was very good. Our Slumbrew (Somerville, of course) Happy Sol at $6 ( a Hefeweizen with honey, orange peel, coriander) was delightfully buzzy. Not buzzy was our server who seemed occasionally distracted and abrupt despite a pause in the action at 3pm
Name: Far Out Ice Cream; Review: This ice cream was really good! They swirl frozen fruit into hard serve sweet cream ice cream to make a light, creamy and delicious product. The flavors are fruit forward but rich enough to please someone who’d normally go for chocolate. Definitely recommend this spot
Name: Siano's Italian Pizzeria & Restaurant; Review: One star is generous. They only accept cash, but have a (convenient) onsite dial up ATM. You walk in, nobody greets you. There are booths and tables, no servers. Nobody welcomes you. You have to go to the cash register in the corner to ask if you are supposed to seat yourself. the food is mediocre at best. They do not have fountain soda, rather you have to purchase bottles of soda from them. I'm glad that I was in the area and did not have to travel far to get there. Otherwise, if I had come from home I would have been very disappointed. To be honest, I have no idea how they are still in business. I should have eaten at the ice cream store next to them. We went there for dessert. Had I known that they had other food at the ice cream store, such as hamburgers and hotdogs, I probably would have had that instead. I was expecting Italian food, but it was more like cardboard pizza with bad flavoring. Do yourself a favor and get some frozen pizza at your local grocery store. I think that even if the service was friendly, or welcoming, I would have given it 2 stars","Name: Eataly Boston; Review: Eataly is a wonderful combination of a grocery store, grab-and-go food options, and sit-down dining.

Name: Mario's Restaurant; Review: I want to give it one star so people don’t run this gem! Old school red sauce looking of place . The husband cooks,the wife runs the front of the house and has a knack for making you feel welcomed. They take pride in their food and  really care that you are enjoying your experience. You don’t see that set up anymore. Love it! Their pistachio gelato is brought in from Sicily and it’s probably the best I’ve ever had . The chocolate is amazing too. Loved the cannoli as well. I can vouch for their espresso. I can’t recommend their Chicken Alla Ursula dish with the fusilli enough. It’s a true staple of mine , and the wines that they have by the bottle are quite lovely without a huge mark up compared to what you normally see at most restaurants

Name: Caffè dello Sport; Review: This small restaurant and pastry shop in the North End certainly has the authentic Italian vibe and is less touristy than some of its neighboring establishments. I've driven past this restaurant many times and always see soccer games or other sporting events playing on the television, and had the opportunity to stop in for some dessert this past weekend. The counter staff was young and energetic and the food was above average and reasonably priced. There were many locals eating when we arrived on Sunday afternoon and it felt like everyone knew each other. I would return to try more of the menu some time, but it seems like this is more of a coffee and dessert spot than a place to get a nice sit down meal. Added points for naming half the menu off famous Italian soccer stars","Name: FoMu; Review: I am Italian. I always like to try new places. This time I got Affogato (4/5) my wife got waffle cone chocolate peanut butter and caramel pumpkin pie ice cream(1/5). My kiddo chocolate mini ice cream. Portions are HUGE that we all could not eat even half of it and had to throw it away. The pumpkin ice cream was all with piece of ice in it really something that you shouldn't sell. After 2 hours we still feel disturbed from the ice cream. I think if the quantity would be 1/3 of it we would have enjoyed more but still a little disturbed. Will not go back, rather go to Amorino or Delini's Gelato

Name: Galleria Umberto; Review: Galleria Umberto is one of the more enigmatic pizzerias I've read about in that it is more of a Sicilian foccaceria than a strict pizzeria.  The prices are very low as others have noted, their menu consists solely of Sicilian snack food, and they tend to run out of things later in the day.  When we got there, they had only 1 sandwich and 2 pizzas left to sell; after that, it was Merry Christmas time for them!  I was sad to miss out on the arancini and panzerotti I'd heard so much about, but thankful I got here before the pizza was gone.  The line was pretty short, and I grabbed 3 slices to share before sitting down in front of the awesome gladiator mural.  This was one of the best Sicilian slices I've had.  The salty, creamy cheese was the defining element, and helped everything meld together beautifully.  Along the edges, it fried along with the crust yielding an addictive, carmelized crispness (the more edges you can get the better, go for corner slices).  In the center, it mixed with the sauce creating a molten, cheesy-tomatoey soup.  This definitely wasn't mozzarella by itself (I suspect aged mozzarella and caciocavallo), but I can't argue with the results.  My only big complaint with the slice was that the undercrust was more spongey than crisp, which is something I've seen before with other authentic Sicilian pizzerias; a little oil (perhaps more cheese) underneath may have done the trick.  My best possible comparison point is that this pizza was like Elio's on steroids--I mean this in the best possible way

Name: NextDoor Cafe; Review: Best ice cream roll in Boston! I tried every flavors and they are all good! The milk tea is not good compared to other places, but 5 stars for the ice cream rolls"
Indian tandoori restaurants,"Name: Halal Indian Cuisine; Review: Where do I begin with this place. From the horrible quality food to the unfriendly staff who overcharged me on two separate occasions for a side item that was supposed to be included in the meal per the menu. Calling the food comparable to frozen Indian food would be disrespectful frozen Indian food from the grocery store. This is the worst tasting Indian food I have ever tried. If your that desperate for Indian food and live in the Brigham Circle area there are plenty of Indian restaurants with take out that deliver to this area with higher quality food FYI
Name: Punjab Palace; Review: While i was hunting for an good indian restaurant with true indian flavour and spices in boston area. I found this restaurant on brighton ave and just  came to try it once. It was on friday evening crowded with many people. I had recieved a great welcome from this guys. I ordered  palak paneer with some garlic bread and it was served with great taste. Mango lassi was really awesome. These guys also do home delivery and they are very sure about 40 min delivery time. It was like another good news for me, where i can get food from the best restaurant within 40 minutes. I would like to rate this restaurant as top indian retaurant where i could not found this taste in the other retaurants which i visited near this area. My friends from different countries like indian food and they all keep asking me the best indian restaurant, so now i can proudly suggest this restaurant for best indian tasty food. Thanks for the management and staff for serving the best indian food
Name: Tandoori Grill; Review: The food was AMAZING and the service was great! Definitely one of the best Indian buffets outside of Boston. The food was cooked perfectly, the bread was extremely fresh, and the owner offered whatever specialty I was craving made to order. I would recommend this to anyone who likes REAL AUTHENTIC HIGH QUALITY INDIAN FOOD. I have eaten at every Indian restaurant in the area and this is by far my favorite. 5 stars!!
Name: Soul of India; Review: I'm Indian and I've eaten a lot of Indian food at lots of different restaurants.   I can safely say Soul of India is at the top of the list for me.   I try and always give a ""pros and cons"" in my reviews, so here goes:  pros:  their buffet is probably the best Indian buffet I've ever had.   It's easily the best deal in town.   I love that they make fresh Naan instead of having it sit under a warmer.   They food has sooooo much flavor.    Many Indian buffets dumb down their food to satisfy the average palette so it's too spicy or overly flavorful, but The Soul seems to care about taste first everything else second. There's always something new and different on the buffet so it's good to go more than once. Dinner there is really good too. Naturally it's going to be a lot more expensive than the buffet but the food is always good. You can tell the chef has had training in other fine restaurants and hotels too because some of his dishes are not traditional and his presentation sometimes has that flare that you would see in higher end restaurants.  cons:   really can't think of anything.   Dinner can get very pricey but I guess that's what you expect when you paying for really good food. The restaurant itself is kind of small but they do a good job of seating customers quickly. I've never had to wait very long for a table at all. Hmmm I guess I'm struggling to find a con prob because there really isn't any.  Conclusion:   this is some of the best Indian food I've ever had and trust me, I've had a lot of Indian food at many different restaurants from the United States to the United Kingdom.   Def check it out.  You won't regret it
Name: Mela Indian Restaurant; Review: Went today on a rainy Thursday, January 24th. Got the Tandoori Chicken and a side of garlic Naan (this of course came with a side of white rice). Unfortunately my waiter had a strong accent, spoke quietly, and seemed to know little English which made communication difficult. Despite that the food was average. The moment the waiter sat down the plate of Tandoori Chicken (which was made incredibly fast and was dry leading me to believe it was just reheated) I saw a thick black hair in the salad that accompanied the chicken. I mean that sort of thing doesn't really bother me that much personally but I know it would disgust most. The rice was also dry and seemed old and/or of poor quality. It reminded me of those ""boil in bag"" rice boxes which again doesn't bother me much personally because the rice came with the meal (which still doesn't mean it's ""free"" of course). The sause that came with the Tandoori chicken was of average flavor. Nothing exciting but not bad. The garlic Naan was fairly good, however it's pretty hard to screw up big time. It was crispy which is personally not how I like it plus they added oil to the top which again isn't personally how I prefer my Naan. You can find two pics with my review. One of the Tandoori Chicken alongside it's side salad and the other showing the hair that was very clearly in the salad when it came to my table. I wouldn't reccomend this place to my friends but I mean it wasn't awful. Cheers mates","Name: Tikkaway Grill; Review: Fast casual Indian with fresh, flavorful ingredients. Brightly lit interior, colorful and cheerful decor, extremely clean, environmentally conscious (compostable containers, and they encourage recycling). Seating is a little limited. We stopped by for a quick dinner and ordered a classic rice bowl minus onions, a roti wrap with chicken and aloo (potato), and a salad bowl with chicken and chana (chickpeas). The masala sauce for the classic rice bowl was very mildly spicy but tolerable for our two children (3 and 6 years of age), and they ate most of the the base ingredients, also a little rice. We loaded up most of the available choices for the wrap and salad bowl (vindaloo sauce, no red onions), which were both delicious. The green chili peppers were quite spicy (more than the vindaloo sauce), which we appreciated. Mango lassi was delicious, not overly sweet. Mint chutney was flavorful and thinner than some other places, mango chutney was actually a little similar to tamarind sauce. Portions were extremely generous, likely could make two lunch meals out of one order unless you have the opportunity to take a little nap afterwards.

Name: Tantric India Bistro; Review: The food here is not bad, but Tantric makes claims that it falls incredibly short of. First off, there is nothing special about the food, nor is it particularly ""regional"" as the place claims, with the exception of some dosa items. A review in a frame on the front of the restaurant lauds it for offering an alternative to the ""over sauced"" mediocre Indian food in America. Ironically, the food is awash in sauces which taste straight out of a jar (the day-glo orange tint of the malai kofta and chicken vindaloo gravies, which taste exactly alike, doesn't help.) If your guests are not into Indian food, this place will probably be fine, if a bit overpriced. But if you have some background in Indian cuisine styles or live amongst an Indian community, you are probably better off going to your local sit-down joint
Name: Halal Indian Cuisine; Review: I visited this place on a Friday afternoon with my wife. We ordered chicken tandoori with garlic naan and 2 lassi. First, the lassi was not chilled. Second, the food was a disaster. It seemed they gave us microwaved left overs from the previous night. The chicken was hard and had a weird taste to it. Moreover, the place wasn't exactly 'clean' and we had to eat with a fly buzzing around. And this experience cost us almost 30 dollars. Please don't go to this place unless you have absolutely no other option
Name: D'tandoor; Review: Had butter chicken. Still can't find one like my dads. They use a lot of tomato sauce rather using heavy cream or sour cream. Very little butter used. First thing is color, butter chicken is light orange. This was dark red and I got medium spice. The biriyani also had too much anise star seasoning. I had one bite and that's all I could taste. I also asked for boneless and they gave me with bone and not much meat. Indian people: just ask your parents or grandparents to make you food. I've been to over 30 Indian restaurants in Mass and they all don't have good curry. Like its not that hard. White people won't complain because they don't know much in the same way Indians don't know if Italian food is good outside. Save your money, eat at home or your aunties
Name: Tandoori Grill; Review: JUST CAME BACK AFTER TRYING THEIR DISGUSTING WEEKEND BUFFET. THIS IS THE WORST INDIAN RESTAURANT THAT I EVER TRIED. IF THERE IS A WAY TO GIVE LESS THAN ONE STAR I WOULD GIVE THIS PLACE -5 STARS.  THE BUFFET WAS OUTRAGEOUSLY PRICED AT $22 AND THE QUALITY OF FOOD WAS NO WHERE UP TO THE STANDARDS. IT WAS OUTRIGHT DISGUSTING AND TASTELESS. I HAD TO HELP OTHERS OUT THERE WHO MIGHT WANT TO TRY THIS RESTAURANT.  PLEASE DO NOT","Name: Tikkaway Grill; Review: Fast casual Indian with fresh, flavorful ingredients. Brightly lit interior, colorful and cheerful decor, extremely clean, environmentally conscious (compostable containers, and they encourage recycling). Seating is a little limited. We stopped by for a quick dinner and ordered a classic rice bowl minus onions, a roti wrap with chicken and aloo (potato), and a salad bowl with chicken and chana (chickpeas). The masala sauce for the classic rice bowl was very mildly spicy but tolerable for our two children (3 and 6 years of age), and they ate most of the the base ingredients, also a little rice. We loaded up most of the available choices for the wrap and salad bowl (vindaloo sauce, no red onions), which were both delicious. The green chili peppers were quite spicy (more than the vindaloo sauce), which we appreciated. Mango lassi was delicious, not overly sweet. Mint chutney was flavorful and thinner than some other places, mango chutney was actually a little similar to tamarind sauce. Portions were extremely generous, likely could make two lunch meals out of one order unless you have the opportunity to take a little nap afterwards. Staff and owner were friendly and extremely gracious, even after a mishap on the part of our son (the younger one). Don't forget to squeeze the horn by the door (""horn please"")

Name: D'Guru; Review: I must say this is some pretty good Indian food! (Sure there is some better Indian restaurants in the city) but they've managed to incorporate authentic Indian cuisine with authentic spices to the point were an average American could eat the entrees. The flavors nice the meat and vegetarian entrees are good. And the price to portion ratio is on point This is a great place for take out and for lunch I recommend if you like Indian cuisin

Name: Cafe Mamtaz; Review: Food was very tasty. Though it's more of a take out place but we wanted to sit down and eat they arranged for two people to sit down and eat, so nice. They were super nice and friendly. We enjoyed talking to them while waiting for our food and sipping delicious mango lassi. Both vegetarian biryani & non-veg tandoori chicken, were good

Name: Punjab Palace; Review: While i was hunting for an good indian restaurant with true indian flavour and spices in boston area. I found this restaurant on brighton ave and just  came to try it once. It was on friday evening crowded with many people. I had recieved a great welcome from this guys. I ordered  palak paneer with some garlic bread and it was served with great taste. Mango lassi was really awesome. These guys also do home delivery and they are very sure about 40 min delivery time. It was like another good news for me, where i can get food from the best restaurant within 40 minutes. I would like to rate this restaurant as top indian retaurant where i could not found this taste in the other retaurants which i visited near this area. My friends from different countries like indian food and they all keep asking me the best indian restaurant, so now i can proudly suggest this restaurant for best indian tasty food. Thanks for the management and staff for serving the best indian food

Name: Tandoori Grill; Review: The food was AMAZING and the service was great! Definitely one of the best Indian buffets outside of Boston. The food was cooked perfectly, the bread was extremely fresh, and the owner offered whatever specialty I was craving made to order. I would recommend this to anyone who likes REAL AUTHENTIC HIGH QUALITY INDIAN FOOD. I have eaten at every Indian restaurant in the area and this is by far my favorite. 5 stars!!"
Mexican enchilada spots,"Name: Papagayo; Review: Not very far from my work place, we decided to go to a Mexican place and this was our choice.  We went at peak hour, so it was kind of packed but there was some place to fit us. When we entered in a guy came to ask for how many people like almost every place, then he took us to our table, not too much waiting, maybe a couple of minutes.  The place is nice, tables are made from wood and there are both benches and chairs. After we sat down, we got the menu very fast, and after taking a look at the drinks we order some Modelo tap beers, they weren't very strong but I liked them.  As appetizers we ordered some nachos with guacamole and salsa, as having the combo was more expensive ( maybe the size was bigger ), but it was more than enough to try them.  Both salsa and guacamole were good, dipping nachos inside them was perfect to wait for the main dish.  we didn't know the difference between burrito and enchilada, so we asked the waiter for that and he kindly explained it to us.  I ordered a beef enchilada, but my friend ordered a burrito. The size is pretty big, with rice, beans, cheese and lettuce as sidedish.  Service was attentive, so before finishing our drinks they asked if we need something more
Name: Mi Casa Tu Casa; Review: I ordered delivery which was pretty good for lunch timing. I got the chicken enchilada plate with a side of plantain. The only issue I had was that I was told the beans were refried but they weren't. Other than that I thought it was very good and very well seasoned. I will definitely order again. The amount of food you get is great for the price, it's basically two meals
Name: Burritos Pizzeria; Review: Large selection, including cheeseburgers, sandwiches and dinners. Very authentic as far as I can tell. I got the chicken enchilada and it came with delicious toppings, rice and black beans.  I rate it 5 stars especially because the lady at the counter was very kind
Name: Picante Taqueria; Review: This one of two Mexican spots in Medford that has very good food. The tacos both chicken and steak were real good, the chicken was probably a little better but still tasteful. The chicken & steak bowl I got also was phenomenal, The rice and beans were great had very good flavors unlike some places that have salty beans and rice, this place had done it just right. The smoothies were surprisingly really good, the papaya smoothie was really pleasant not really sweet and the piña colada was a little bit sweeter but it tastes just as good. The restaurant was nice and spacious felt cozy as well. The service is excellent and friendly and quick. Would put this place in the top 2 Mexican spots in just Medford. Phenomenal 👌
Name: Pueblo Viejo; Review: El Pueblo Viejo makes the most delicious pupusas I’ve tasted so far here in Massachusetts. This is my family’s first option for pupusas. But I’ve also tried some of their Mexican dishes, I’d say their Mexican dishes are not typical Mexican food it’s more like Taco Bell. However, this is a great restaurant to take your family. Great service, the ladies are always polite and attentive. I wish I could give 5 stars but you guys need to improve on your Mexican dishes. I do recommend this restaurant","Name: El Centro Mexican Restaurant; Review: What a great mix of traditional Mexican fare and some special dishes that will knock your shocks (and shoes) off! Don't miss the empanadas. Share them with the table, and no matter how many you get, it will always be too few. At my most recent visit I kept it simple and traditional: chips and salsa, a house margarita and the chimichanga. Tasty and fresh food.  I could taste the individual ingredients and not feel weighed down. Think of it as a dish as any Chef Juanita, or Chef Juan, would me proud to share with the neighbors. The staff is great, attentive without being overbearing and they know the menu inside and out. You can go to Chili's, Qdoba, or Taco Bell anytime. Do yourself a favor and for just a couple extra bucks you can have Mexican meal which is so authentic that you may actually feel guilty for not sending postcards
Name: El Paso Enchiladas; Review: I got the chicken enchilada and my friend got a chicken quesadilla, basically filled with store bought buffalo chicken dip chicken and barely any cheese on either (and that's it). Also sour cream is extra? For a meal that cost me $11? Rice was absolutely tasteless as well. Don't waste money
Name: El Paso Enchiladas; Review: VEGAN OPTIONS GUYS in a sea of non-vegan restaurants. Such a sight for sore eyes when I saw these vegan empanadas. They are edible, not the best ones I've ever had but decent. Prices are fair. Staff is nice and friendly
Name: Emilianoz Mexican Grill; Review: LOVE this place! I have tried most things on their menu and have never been dissatisfied. Great people and wonderful food. Favorites are the chicken enchiladas, fish tacos and the carne asada--but no matter what you get, make sure you get their rice and beans! Simple, but perfect
Name: El Paso Enchiladas; Review: Quite possibly the worst Mexican food I’ve had inside or outside the US. The chicken was sweet and maybe cooked in just Tabasco. The guacamole was gummy; instead of just falling off the spoon it sort of oozed like it was full of fillers or something to make it more gooey than any other guacamole I’ve seen. I’ve lived in New Mexico, California, and Arizona, as well as MA. I’ve seen good and bad Mexican food of all Mexican food regions. This was just so abysmally terrible I had to throw away my entire meal. I feel terrible for the poor chickens and farmers who contributed to this meal","Name: El Paso Enchiladas; Review: I got the chicken enchilada and my friend got a chicken quesadilla, basically filled with store bought buffalo chicken dip chicken and barely any cheese on either (and that's it).

Name: Chilacates Mission Hill; Review: Great Mexican with a great selection of ingredients and well put together meals. I had a burrito with the verde pork and it was flavorful and delicious. They also have some great chips though I was a bit disappointed in the flavor of the salsa - it didn't have much spice to it. One thing I was extremely happy to see were the tamales on the menu and enjoyed the chicken tamale immensely - that is something that can be hard to find up north. Seating is limited but it is a great location for take out. Well worth your time and money to stop by

Name: Taqueria y Pupuseria Mi Ranchito; Review: The food was delicious and fresh! I had a chicken gordita, pupusas and a chicken enchilada and all were tasty! The papas locas/ crazy fries were so good! My husband had the mixed fajitas and enjoyed them. Highly recommended this restaurant just like mom's yummy cooking

Name: Chilacates South End; Review: This Chilacates was my go to before every night class at RCC. When super hungry, you can get a filling burrito. Even the smaller size (guey) will fill you up. My Mexican friends agree that their Tostadas are praiseworthy. That’s what I get when I need something lighter before class, as a Burrito might encumber me as I attempt to teach my night class. If you didn’t know, Chilacates is a popular chain and their prices reflect that. I wouldn’t call them expensive, but Roxbury and Dorchester have family owned Dominican joints that offer more copious amounts of food for real cheap. Pay with cash when possible. They have one of those fancy computer tip screens that they swing around and put in your face.  They also have some specialty drinks and a good selection of meats for your taco, burrito, etc. I recommend getting your tostada al pastor. If you are in the nighborhood and are looking for a quick burrito, this is the spot to go","Name: Cactus Mexican Grill; Review: If you're looking for a delicious, mouth watering, good priced burrito... This is the spot!! The burritos are filling, tasty, and huge! I come here mainly for the burritos :) it's a small spot and always busy! It's located down the street from Maverick station. So next time you're getting off the train after work and are so hungry.. or are just looking for a filling home made meal, come here. Conveniently located for your cravings

Name: Herrera's Mexican Grill; Review: Visiting Boston, MA for the first time. Asked locals what to check out- they recommended this. So glad they did! The food is fresh and the line was out the door. I ordered tacos. Delicious. My dad ordered an enchilada- I tasted it- the best enchilada I've ever had. Also- they have plenty of salsas to choose from

Name: El Triunfo; Review: Do not let this small location fool you, its hands down one of the best mexican restaurants in the South End.  A good sized taco with everything on it is only 3.00$ plus tax, and the rest of their delicious food choices are pretty damn affordable too. Their fajitas and enchiladas are to die for. For someone married with a mexican with high standards for authentic mexican this is his our go-to spot, their stuff is the real deal!  Late hours is a plus, it's one of the only GOOD restaurants opened after midnight that isn't a pizzeria. Customer service is mild, they arent rude or unprofessional but they arent all up in your face with being top notch in service and friendliness either so no complaints here.  Will be visiting yet again soon

Brunch delivery options,"Name: Tavern On the Water; Review: The service was great and for brunch for two we only paid $26. Will come back again
Name: Pollos A La Brasa El Chalan; Review: Today August 27 at around 4:10 I asked for a delivery, it was my first time asking for a delivery in this restaurant and the truth was the experience was very bad, I do not recommend it to anyone, they told me that the Delibery would arrive in 40 minutes because the address was local, when an hour had passed I called and a very rude man answered me, and he told me that delivery was going to hit me, and I told him that in how much time more and he said ""I don't know in about 10 minutes maybe ""I hung up and half an hour later they call me that the delivery is out,"" WHAT DO THESE PEOPLE HAVE IN THEIR HEAD? 1:30 hours for a local delivery ?? Are you kidding me ?? I told the driver that I no longer wanted him because it was too long and he replied with an ""Okay"" What lousy and uneducated people, anyway ..... they didn't recommend that they order here.
Name: Pad Thai Cafe; Review: It's sad to say that this restaurant is getting worse and worse. I order food delivery from them every week and every time when the order is delayed, I have to be the one contact the delivery guy. I ordered food today and 2 hrs passed I still haven't heard from the delivery guy. I called the restaurant and no one trying to help they don't even have a contact number of the delivery man. I will not go back. Very disappointed. At the end I I got the food late but it's not my order. I randomly get something else but not Thai food. This is ridiculous. I lost my money and I didn't get anything
Name: Emilio's Pizza; Review: They deliver ! But wouldn't deliver the food to my door , the driver parked down the street and told me to walk but got an attitude bc I explained that I pay for delivery so no matter what he needed to bring me my delivery ! INSTEAD HE PULLED OFF WITH MY FOOD ! Worst delivery experience ever !! They have no shame in what they say or how they go about the situation
Name: Sky Restaurant; Review: If you're ever looking for a place to hold a Sunday brunch for a special event, THIS IS THE PLACE!!! Perfectly prepared portions of breakfast and lunch items adorn the buffet room. Choose from scrambled eggs to fish picatta...And don't forget the salad options - usually three or more. And then there's the additional differentiators you rarely find - a make your own Bloody Mary bar (choose from six or more base options), and a CHOCOLATE FOUNTAIN.

Name: Panificio Bistro & Bakery; Review: Settling at 3.5 stars for Panifico. Given it was Sunday brunch time, every place on Charles St was super busy with long lines so we went back to Panifico which had few tables free.  Easily found on main Charles st and so close to Charles MGH station. You order first then you sit with your order nr. Prices here were decent (well, compared to the Bay Area :P) and service was minimal. Good options on the brunch menu from egg dishes, salads, sandwiches and pancakes etc.  The four of us opted for:  - smoked salmon eggs benny. This was really good and not super heavy with good portions. - eggs florentine. Lovely and light vegetarian option. - huevos ranchero. My hubby was content with it tho seemed a bit on the dry side. - chicken sausage hash. Not exactly what the person who ordered it had in mind. She was very disappointed with the huge portion and not so good taste-wise.  Coffee and fresh OJ was decent. Overall the experience was good but nothing to write home about. Would love to try other places in the area
Name: ELSA'S EATERY; Review: We had breakfast here today, trying out a new brunch thing they have going on Saturday and Sunday mornings.  It was mostly a single page menu for the brunch with 4-5 beverage (non-alcoholic) selections.  They also had 4-5 alcoholic selections available.  The portion size was HUGE, and I could only finish 1/2 of it, and it was super yummy.  Service was great, and the kitchen was speedy!  After discussing it for a while, we decided I got a Bertucci's vibe from them, if I had to compare it to a chain.  The parking is in back, and is right next to the door, there is no huge walk to get in.  I took a few photos, I'll see if I can upload them here as well
Name: Sky Restaurant; Review: Great brunch, but pricey. Need to be strategic to make it worthwhile. The made to order omelets are great and so are the carved meats. Salmon cakes were delicious. Fresh fruits and salads were nice. Desserts were overly sweet, and the wake-up l waffle batter was pretty plain tasting. Didn't have room to try the roasted chicken or the short rib roll ups. Bloody Mary bar was delicious. The service was very nice and efficient. It wasn't very busy, and everything was kept nice and clean, food was hot and refreshed often
Name: Beacon Hill Hotel & Bistro; Review: Absolutely flawless brunch. The menu is small, but diverse, without getting too crazy with any sort of fusion dishes. My girlfriend and I split the following: Muesli: Delicious. Not too sweet muesli base with cooked cinnamon apples, figs, and I believe some pears. Topped with fresh strawberries and a very high quality low-fat yoghurt. French Toast: Phenomenal. Pullman loaf cooked PERFECTLY so that the outside is browned and the inside is set up like a custard. Topped with cooked cinnamon apples and spiced creme fraiche and light amber maple syrup on the side. Mushroom Omelette: Again, perfect. Eggs cooked perfectly and mushrooms not soggy. Served with french fries.  One of those rare places that decides to cook a limited number of things, but cooks them flawlessly. All the above food cost $40 in total.

Name: Crispy Crepes Cafe; Review: My favorite place to eat on campus! They have the best scrambled egg in Boston!! I love the soft taste of scrambled egg, and most of other brunch places in local area cook too much. Bacon is also one of my favorite. I usually come here for brunch before class. Egg special is what I always have. The boss is a very nice guy. He makes you feel welcome

Name: Big Apple Restaurant; Review: Some days cereal just doesn’t cut it and you want a little something more. Hence why I started skimming my local DoorDash breakfast options and came across Big Apple. I was shocked at the amazing reviews they had on the app and surprised I had never heard of it before, being one town over, and a breakfast lover.  Screw it, I thought, it’s pay day! For food, I ordered a eggs Benedict and chose the ham option but there were several options including veg. The egg was poached perfectly, the English muffin wasn’t soggy at all, and the Hollandaise sauce was made very very well. Homemade most likely. It came with home fries too and my lord were those seasoned well - not too salty but flavorful. And they didn’t have the dreaded burnt pieces nor were they soggy. They were just right, which can be rare to find with a diner doing Delivery of all things.  Finally, the coffee, the caramel iced latte heaven. Absolutely decadent and the perfect pick me up.  I will 100% order from here again

Name: Asana; Review: Fantastic food and impeccable service. My girlfriend and I have been here for brunch, lunch, and dinner. Their staff is incredibly friendly and knowledgeable. And the seafood is amazing! It is a bit pricy, but definitely will impress a date. The booth tucked away in the middle of the restaurant adds for a nice romantic feel to this luxurious hotel restaurant. Too bad they don't serve their brunch buffet anymore, it was the best I've ever tasted

Name: Church; Review: Church is a great little gem in the Fenway area. It's a few streets back from Brookline Ave, so it doesn't bring in the typical Red Sox fans that populate the area during game days. I've only visited the restaurant, but they also have a music venue and host different bands each weekend. I've been here for brunch and dinner and have been very pleased with the menu and service every time. The food menu and cocktail menu changes frequently and has creative options. My favorite brunch item is the toad in the hole. It's french toast, with bacon, syrup, and whipped cream. I paired this with the blood orange mimosa, which brought this to one of my top 5 brunches ever! Highly recommend"
Gourmet burger delivery near me,"Name: Regina Pizzeria; Review: This review is NOT about the Pizza. The pizza is standard american style pizza with no specialties but overpriced.  This review is about the way they treat their customers. It was my 1st time visit Regina after they were voted on tripadvisor for the best pizzeria in the U.S. I didn´t pay much attention to the menu since I was gonna to order two slices and I trusted them. So I ordered one gourmet and one single topping (I didn't know at that time). When I went to the counter, the girl asked what kind of pizza I ordered, I told her that I wasn´t sure. She said okay and immediately pushed some button and it showed $9.10 for two slices. Then I asked her how was that possible. They have a meal of two gourmet slices plus a soda for $8.90 and she asked for $9.10 for two slices she wasn´t sure. So she went back to check with her coworker. Then she modified it to $8.50. I thought that since it is only 40 cents in different, then I ordered the meal of two gourmet slices. Later while I was eating, I took a look at the menu board and notice that the price for 1 topping is $3.95 and $4.25 for gourmet. Since I order one slice of 1 topping and one slice of gourmet, the price should be $8.20 instead of $8.50. [All prices are listed as before tax].  Business is business, I felt that the staffs there just tried to fool me and charge me for being a new customer who is not familiar with the price. Not even mention that they gave me the least covered slice in the remainings. This is the last time for me to this place
Name: 5 Napkin Burger; Review: Disappointed all around.  The best part of the ""burger"" was the bun and the toppings.  I ordered online to pick up. The website told me estimated pick up time -  30 minutes.  I got there 30 minutes later to a near empty restaurant. Don't know what would take 30 minutes to make my fairly simple order of Bacon Cheddar Burger and cheese tots.  Well the order must have not taken 30 minutes and was sitting on the bar there for me when I got in there,and 2 minutes later when I got to my hotel room, the burger and the cheese tots were cold.  Burger was warm, the tots were legitimately COLD.  Other reviews say how huge the burgers are.  Mine was not so big.  It is not one of those big fat juicy burgers that is round and dripping with juice.  It was one of those flat thin burgers that reminded me of those frozen pre made burgers that were served from the food service, thrown on the grill frozen and just cooked from there.  The website allows you to choose your burger either medium or well-done.  I put in the notes on my order medium rare.  The burger was not hardly cooked.  It wasn't medium rare.  It was basically seared on both sides of the thin wimpy burger and then raw on the middle. The meat quality was poor since it was raw, I had to pick out all sorts of grisle and uncooked meat.  Then the Bacon Cheddar burger further disappointed.   There was no bacon on the burger. I think the cook was perhaps confounded by the infrequent ""medium-rare"" request and forgot about topping the Bacon Cheddar burger with bacon. To my dismay, the cold tots, numbered only 11 in a paper container that looked not so different from a fast food restaurant. With the paltry serving size, the cold 11 tots looked pathetic in the large container. The sesame brioche and toppings on the burger were satisfactory.  The raw white onion on top was nice flavor and mild, and sliced nice and thin.  The butter lettuce seemed fresh and clean.  The cheese was melted  and the bun toasted.  But boil it all down and you have a burger that is 3x the price of a fast food burger, that is not even as good as a fast food burger, and all for what?  Cause there is a burger fad that these guys had a vision to create the perfect burger?  I can see what they had envisioned, and perhaps another location of theirs has it mastered, but the location in Back Bay, Boston missed by a long shot.  Save your extra $10 and get a better fast food burger at any of the crappy little chains
Name: Cobblestone Café; Review: I thought this restaurant isn't everything people are screaming about,  the medium burger my son ordered was rare and he asked for no tomatoes. He said the flavor was good but only ate half the burger. (Because it was rare) if you claim to be the best burger in town (which most of boston does) than be the best burger in town! That means from the beginning to the end, get the order right, cook it right, and serve it right. My husband ordered a well cooked burger and it was pink! Good job guys. So not impressed and will not return nor will recommend

Name: Boston Burger Company; Review: This was my third time visiting a Boston Burger company and I am really sad about my experience yesterday.  I arrived around 6:45PM and the place wasn't very busy.  My friend and I sat down and ordered a beer, my beer was flat but I understand it happens sometimes so I didn't say anything.  I ordered the Kitchen Sink Burger priced at $15.50 cooked medium.  When it arrived it was cooked well done and didn't look like the colossal burger I remembered.  The burger resembled a typical fast food burger with a slim patty, and small fixings.  I was debating on whether or not to tell the waitress but I figured, there are only 5 people in the restaurant and if the kitchen is putting is out weak burgers without being busy it is better to not say anything.  I ate half my burger, told the waitress about the burger and told her not to worry.   I ordered a Freak Shake which was excellent but again very expensive.   After paying $50.00 for a burger, shake, beer, and tip I visited the bathroom which was filthy.  Paper towels were all over the floor, the toilet clogged, urine was on the floor, and the sink was a mess.  Again, only 5 people in the restaurant!   I really wanted to experience the Boston Burger Company I remembered but sadly it was a bad night","Name: Five Guys; Review: Went to order a quick burger 🍔, and there were not any lines to the cashier. Seems the online orders were working well since all the staff in the store seemed busy cooking and preparing food.  I got to order my burger with a double wooper with mayo, mushrooms with a slice of tomatoes. Yummy 😋!  After I finish paying for my order, it only took less than 10 minutes for my burger to be ready. While waiting, I got to see the chef make the burgers. They have an open kitchen where I got to see them fry the burger on the stove. The smell was so enticing, and it all felt natural since the burger was not precook and was still a reddish color before being cook.  After getting the burger, I ate it right there in the store. And since there were barely anyone in the store (mostly staff), I did not have to worry about any contamination with covid issues.  The burger tasted great, juicy and filling. Took me 3 to 4 minutes to finish and rush back to work
Name: Beta Burger; Review: Really good burgers. They really talk up the sous vide thing, and I wish I could tell the difference, but it would seem that it should be a bit healthier. Staff are really nice and it seems to be locally run. There's a nice lady there who I think is the owner and always looks for genuine feedback. Better than most fast food
Name: Tasty Burger; Review: I maintain that there are basically two burger places in downtown Boston. One is the Boston Burger Company, which is known for their absurdly expensive and quite frankly ridiculous burgers (which I'm not knocking, it's just - have you ever actually TRIED to eat their 420 Burger?) The other is Tasty Burger, which is a significantly more sane and down-to-earth diner environs in which you can enjoy a normal burger.  It's basically a bar, really, and it minces no words about it. You go there to get a big cold beer, eat a (really tasty) Big Tasty burger with a side of absurdly greasy onion rings, and finish it off with a tiny pie. Who cares, it's a good burger joint, it doesn't try to be anything else. It's also one of the only places around here that actually serves Cheerwine. You remember Cheerwine? Where else can I get it around here? Who supplies these people? These are the everyday mysteries that vex me.  Their chicken parm sandwich ""suffers"" from an INCREDIBLE amount of cheese stretch, which did mildly incapacitate my girlfriend when I took her there. It's a bit of a choking hazard if you're unprepared. Just a word of warning.  The food is reasonably priced for the portions, and I guarantee you won't walk away hungry. The tables have a wide variety of different sauces and stuff, like a big basket thing full of pretty much all the condiments, including the ones that don't make any sense to use on any of their menu items. The fry spice blend is quite good. Don't overdo it, though, it can get overpowering.  They also sell merch, like some kind of weird clothing brand. I don't get who it's marketed towards (the Cracker Barrel business model does NOT work in cities,) but I have to admit that a knockoff Supreme box logo shirt that says ""Big Tasty"" on it is a hilarious novelty.  You can buy a whole sack of hamburgers for like 30 dollars, give or take. That's insane. Review over
Name: B.GOOD; Review: I'm somewhat surprised at the number of positive reviews for the B. Good burger.  The bun it came on was surprisingly good, though somewhat earthy in flavor, with more chew than your typical commercial burger bun.  While the bun/patty ratio seems good, the fact that the bun doesn't squish the way that a typical commercial bun would, means that eating the burger is rather messy.  Yes, the burger comes wrapped in paper, but because the burger itself is rather small and dense, the wrapping does less to keep one's hands clean than to get in one's way while trying to eat it.  I ordered the mushroom Swiss burger, which was tasty enough, though the mushrooms were cold.  And I mean, straight-out-of-the-refrigerator cold, which was an unpleasant contrast to the warm bun, hot patty, sauteed onions, and melted Swiss.  Yes, the burger tasted somewhat more ""fresh"" and homemade than other fast food burgers, but then, that's not really what a fast food burger is about.  Anyway, this place caters to a crowd that wants to feel that they are eating healthy/healthier options and I think B. Good delivers on that front.  However, to compare this place to Tasty Burger is just so, so, deeply incorrect
Name: Boston Burger Co-Davis Sq; Review: The burgers are amazing!  The burger patty itself is quality!  Then you have all these fun combinations. Some more suite my taste while others are more for a college student coming off a bender.  I had Green Monster with Mac & Cheese (grilled) my wife made her own.  We also had the nacho fries.  No doggie bag for me  The Green Monster and the nacho fries had really good pico de gallo. There only a few places in MA with good pico de gallo, this is one of them.  The menu is straight forward; however, they allow for substitutions and cusotmer.  Lots of table turn over, but there is no rush... Yes they have outdoor seating.

Name: B.Good; Review: In all honesty, it's the best burger I've ever had other than from home or a family cookout. Sweet potato fries seem to have been grilled vs fried. They were crispy enough on the outside a beautifully fluffy on the inside. Wife had the Southwest salad and was completely satisfied. We stopped at this location before our Delta flight from terminal A. It was quite expensive, but we chalked that up to being located at airport. Never been to any other location","Name: Teriyaki House; Review: I could eat here for the rest of my life. The spicy chicken bowl with lo mein is heaven when you have a hang over. People complain about delivery but all you need to do is COMMUNICATE. They come to my house so often they call me to come down before they even pull up. Order wrong just give them a call and they will accommodate you. Faster delivery include the tip on the card and you can grab your food and go. Need faster pick up use grubhub. Bubble tea is yummy. Smoothies are filling. Location is small but lively

Name: Noble Roman's Pizza; Review: They make the best specially breaded french fries and onion rings ever. Their hamburgers are also delicious. And they have very friendly customer service...thank you

Name: Shake Shack; Review: Not very happy with my first try with this place. So I ordered from GrubHub on 12/16/19 at around 1:55pm. Just ordered a Shack Burger and an order of Cheese Fries; nothing too crazy. At 2:04, it said that the order was being prepared. I went to check the tracking around 2:45 to see where the update was, but for some reason, it still said the order was being prepared and estimated delivery was gonna be at 3:05-3:15. Decided to let it slide and check again in a few minutes. By 3:30, it still said it was being prepared, but delivery time stayed at 3:05-3:15. Being the patient guy I am, I still let it slide and didn't think too much about it. Around 4:45pm, I still heard nothing and went to check the status, but for some reason, now it said that the food was delivered! At that point, I started to look for some number to call. I called the main line and chose the option to speak to the manager, but no one answered at all. I tried to call back again and still no answer. Then when I send a text to the delivery driver, magically, my phone rings and my order is outside. All that is very bad and that's not even the worst part! The worst part was that when I went to take a bite, cold fries (and the cheese wasn't helping anything) and a cold burger! So this tells me that my food was cooked and ready to go hours ago and was just left sitting there. Maybe they were short on drivers or having a busy day, who knows, but at least call me and let me know so I'm not sitting there guessing! Or maybe this restaurant can't handle having to prep deliveries AND keep up with restaurant-goers at the same time. If that's the case, don't have your restaurant on GrubHub for delivery and leave it as just an in-house restaurant. Far from the best experience for me

Name: Great Taste; Review: Great food I would really recommend the hamburgers or the wings there really amazing I have came back multiple times it's an amazing restaurant I met the owners they are really nice I really recommend this restauran

Name: Sixth Gear - Cask & Kitchen; Review: . We ordered the Black and Blue Burger cooked medium. I ordered the Broadway sirloin cooked well done.  The dinners were brought to us with the burger cooked well and the steak cooked medium. I could not eat the steak the way it was prepared so I sent it back to be cooked a bit longer. My husband was hungry so he ate the burger even though it was over cooked.  When the waitress eventually brought my food back out again, the steak was still medium well. By that time, my husband had already finished eating his over cooked burger and I knew I didn't have enough time to send the steak back to the kitchen again, so I asked for my dinner to go and told the waitress I would take it home and cook it myself.  There were only 2 other patrons in the restaurant. No reason for our order to not be right."

Name: 5 North Square; Review: Wow, this might be the most disappointing experience I've had. First off, my girlfriend and are vegan and asked for the vegan menu, yet we were served butter. We specified we were both vegan, a little butter won't kill me, but  I'll pray for anyone with a nut or seafood allergy. We went for lunch and the vegan menu was meant for dinner (and extremely overpriced, considering the quality of our food).  The food was not terrible just extremely overpriced (we did send back the ""vegan"" dish that had butter, and they did replace it with a vegan one, and it's honestly worth wondering if they simply washed it off the butter and added garlic and oil)
Name: Ginza Japanese; Review: Great place for Boston Sushi
Name: LoLa 42 Boston; Review: If I could give negative start, I would. Your overpriced sushi taste similar or worst than a cheap supermarket sushi. You should change your chef, because he/she obviously doesn't know what the real sushi taste like. I would never mind paying the  fancy price for a good food, but let's face the fact that your food doesn't deserve the price. I've been to many upscale sushi restaurants around the world, noting taste as awful as your sushi, especially for the price, 3 rolls + miso soup for $120.. Ridiculous for the quality. I would not pay $5 for your sushi, if I only knew it would be this awful
Name: MIGHTY LOVE FOOD; Review: What a great eating experience! My wife and I are vegan, so we're always looking for new places to try. They've got LOTS of choices, so it was hard to pick just one dish - I got the vegan mac n cheese and the vegan sloppy joe. But vegan or not, I can tell you it's one of the best mac n cheeses you'll ever have! And the staff was so friendly. They all took turns telling us about the food and treated us like guests. The manager offered to customize any dishes we wanted. If we lived any closer, I might get broke & fat from going here all the time. We'll certainly go back next time we make it into Boston","Name: Genki Ya - Boston; Review: Cornucopia of vegan and gluten-free offerings, including maki with tofu skin, and maki with a colorful variety of veggies and fruit. Try the shiso leaf and ume sour plum roll for something refreshing! You have a choice of white, brown, or multigrain rice for any roll. Don't miss every vegetarian's favorite maki: Veggie Dragon Roll. Pro tip: sub spinach for the banana in aforementioned roll! Enhanced savory goodness. There is some over reliance on cream cheese and tempura flakes, but the basic healthy rolls like Avo-cuke-asparagus, avo-spinach, and simple maki with salmon, yellowtail, or tuna are always available. Ohitashi sesame-marinated steamed spinach salad is also a delicious classic. Great way to get more greens. The Naruto roll is great for people eating low carb: it's shrimp, ""crabstick,"" avocado, and tobiko wrapped in a thin sheet of vinegared cucumber instead of rice. And it is delicious!
Name: Genki Ya - Boston; Review: Are you vegetarian? Genki Ya states on their website that they are “committed to providing the healthiest and highest quality sushi”. Dine here confident that you will be consuming safe organic sushi. Their menu even states what is or isn’t organic! If you hesitate going out to dinner with friends and family because of a limited menu, try this joint. Their menu provides a wide variety of vegetarian appetizers and Maki rolls to enable you a dynamic dining experience. I especially recommend the Vege Combo (Vege Comdo on the menu). For $18.95, you get a vege dragon roll, sweet potato roll, and avocado/cucumber roll (with miso soup included).  There are two dining areas split between the main floor and second story. The second story has a bar and traditional seating, though stairs seem to be the only access to the second story. The main floor has a sushi bar as well as traditional seating. The restaurant is well let and clean (including the restrooms). Parking at Genki Ya is a beast. Be prepared to spend fifteen minutes driving around looking for a free spot on the side of the road. I recommend parking a distance from the restaurant and walking the rest of the way. However, the restaurant is ideally located next to the theater district. Grab a quick bite before or after the show
Name: Irashai Sushi; Review: I am sure they have decent food, I would just not know because they just did NOT have vegetarian options. The restaurant was easy to find, it was clean and way too well staffed. When we only ordered some veggie fried rice to share the server became short with us. We honestly went there to eat but were not going to waste money on a bunch of rice. The portion was huge by the way and easy to share.  The veggie fried rice is good but it needs soy sauce because it lacked flavor. Not my best experience at a restaurant and I think the manager needs to check his labor, I will not be returning here unless they make changes
Name: Snappy Sushi; Review: <There is no sushi restaurant series in Boston.> March 17 travel destination visit. There are also shops that are not Japanese-owned sushi shops in the US, so make sure that the manager is Japanese before visiting. On the 1st floor, the group customers were main, so sushi was only at the BF counter. Beer will only be Samuel Adams Boston Lager since he came to Boston ❗ The knob is kimchi tofu. However, cold tofu that came out is what tofu! Well, why not silk? The craftsman was Mexican, but this is the reality of an American sushi restaurant.  It was cold and I was also inspired by the ramen that was on the menu, but after all I could not eat sushi and my identity as a Japanese would be lost. I asked for Spicy Scallop Roll to try a little different species.  I paid attention to the arrangement because I love scallops, but with a medium finish, I managed to recover tofu.

He's been a vegetarian for nearly a year now, and I'm following close behind on that health journey. We ordered the Oshun wrap, African Pot bowl, plus the Mango Moon and Blueberry Bash juices. We devoured each of our halves of the wrap with gooey, vegan cheese, seasoned kale and curry chickpea stew. We couldn't finish the bowl, which filled an entire large square takeout container. The spice of the lentil stew was absolute perfection on top of the fluffy, yellow couscous mixed with more kale and red cabbage. Needless to say we polished off the leftovers today. We both preferred the mango moon juice, mainly because of the can't go wrong mixture of turmeric, cinnamon, and agave with more of the consistency of a smoothie. The blueberry and banana juice didn't go unnoticed either, if you're a fan of those flavors.

Name: Dragon Bowl; Review: Vegans beware, I thought I might be able to get an easy side of tofu or something here, but they were unfortunately hard to communicate with.  Didn't seem to really understand what vegan was, and didn't seem to care to listed when I elaborated, very rushing and when I tried to ask about the menu their answers were more confusing.  Looked like good food and they give big portions so I'd love to know which options were actually truly vegan and I'd go back","Name: Genji Sushi; Review: This is not really a stand alone restaurant, it is the sushi products sold in the whole foods.

Gluten-free bakery options,"Name: Saladworks; Review: Delicious bakery! Nice place to eat and pick and go
Name: Davio's Northern Italian Steakhouse; Review: I frequent Davio's often for lunch, mostly because it has absolutely scrumptious gluten-free pizza (which is why it made my list of 11 Best Gluten-Free Restaurants in Boston). So when I heard they were adding an extensive gluten-free brunch menu, I jumped at the opportunity to try it out!  Davio's in Boston's Back Bay is a classy place, white tablecloths included. It's perfect for a fancy girl's brunch, a date, or to take your parents to when they're in town.  We started with the Caesar Salad, which was delicious and came with the most scrumptious parmesean crisps. I love how they were generous with the anchovies - for some reason a lot of restaurants skimp out on those, but their salty texture is so great paired with the romaine lettuce!  My sweet tooth was super excited about the gluten-free french toast and berry plate!

Name: L'Aroma Cafe; Review: This cafe is best known, in my mind, for it's coffee and tea selections. I'm always pleased with the fine work the l'aroma baristas artfully create. In particular, I'm a fan of the espresso drinks and tea refreshers. They're comparable in price to Starbucks, but the added bonus is supporting local business and the atmosphere is less big box commercial.  While I can't speak to most of the food because I'm gluten-free they've added a few bakery items that aren't terrible. I've tried the gluten-free lemon poppy seed muffin and it was a bit dense but overall satiated my bakery craving. Calorie-wise I would have rather had the panna cotta with berries, which is a delightful gluten-free option. If you work or live in the area level-up or their customer loyalty punch card is helpful.  Overall it's a solid cafe choice that supports local businesses and lends itself to shorter lines and less corporate interactions with the staff
Name: Tavern in the Square Shrewsbury; Review: Not impressed. Like many have said, the food is overpriced for what it is, but that wasn't even the big issue. My mother has celiac disease and we have to be very careful about where we eat. She ordered gluten free Mac and cheese and the manager himself brought it over and it had a allergy flag in it.  Then a young woman brought some over after him, which looked totally different. We said we hope that it's not gluten free because she's already had been eating the one the manager brought over. The girl was immediately panicked and absolutely certain she had the gluten free Mac and cheese. While she was checking on it someone else brought over my not gluten free Mac and cheese and we knew by looking at it that the one my mother was eating was not the gluten free one. Small mistake maybe we could seriously land someone in the hospital. Allergies are a serious concern for some and the managers of all people should be aware of what they're bringing over to the table, especially since it looks completely different. That manager then went on to blame his expo mistake on the chef. The general manager came over to have us fill out an injury report to make sure their buts were covered. Do not go here if you have a real allergy
Name: Real Deal, LLC; Review: This place carries gluten-free options for sandwiches and pizza. This alone is noteworthy--It is really difficult to make gluten-free alternatives. Real Deal deserves kudos for incorporating these options on to their menu. However, after trying them three times now, I can say that they do not have the best gluten-free buns or pizza crust in town. The bun falls apart halfway through eating (I hate sloppy food so this annoys me). The pizza crust stays intact but needs to be cooked longer for my taste--It does not not have that charred look like the normal pizzas. It also comes in one size (and no single-slice option). 3 stars kind of feels harsh, because my fiancee (no allergy) loves Real Deal's regular menu. So, maybe it is 4 stars overall, but I'd say 3 stars specifically for their average tasting g-free options and blase customer service","Name: Chill Kitchen and Bar; Review: I have been dinning at Chill since they opened last year. I am always satisfied with the food, service, and experience.  Recently, my husband has been diagnosed with Celiac disease, so he truly needs gluten free options. We went to Chill for dinner with friends this weekend and were pleasantly surprised with the gluten free options. Our waitress told us almost all menu options (with a couple of exceptions) can be made gluten free - even the burgers. The owners, John and Coleen, have decided to stock gluten free breads and sauces (no gluten in their soy), etc. and make sure they are cooked separately. If you are gluten free especially because of an allergy, this place is an absolute must!!  If you don't have dietary restrictions, I recommend anything on the menu. I specifically enjoy the steak and cheese egg rolls and the Chill chop salad with chicken salad on top
Name: Flour Bakery; Review: Visiting Boston for the weekend and stumbled upon Flour Bakery. Giving us the local feel with the added customer service.  Refreshing to find a cafe with so many vegan options. I ordered a mouth watering vegan double chocolate muffin. The cashier suggested it be warned, she was not wrong! That thing was deliciousssssssss.  Be a little patient, it’s located in a high traffic intersection (hospital and hotels)
Name: Al Dente Ristorante; Review: First, I choose this restaurant because of the raving reviews of their attention to detail for people who are gluten free or have Celiac disease. I personally have Celiac disease, so finding an Italian restaurant that is authentic and understanding of cross contamination is super important to me.  I had the gluten free pasta and gluten free garlic bread. The garlic bread was not what you would imagine; it was more like a dense flat bread. It was worth the purchase though. I had the pasta dish at the top of the house specials page with veal, shrimp, and chicken in a garlic wine sauce. I thought it was rather tasteless and the gluten free pene was nothing better than I could've bought from any grocery store. Pretty disappointing for close to $30. Maybe it's because we came 30 minutes before the kitchen closed? But I felt that we were early enough to not be THAT customer.  Al Dente is my girlfriend and her family's favorite Italian restaurant. I had only been here once before about  year ago. I would try it again, but more because it's safe place I can find sustainance for myself and that it has awesome food for people without Celiac disease. I wouldn't return simply to enjoy their food on my own though.  Celiac friendly? Yes. Delicious? Meh. Go cook your own Udi's pasta and save $30
Name: Davio's Northern Italian Steakhouse; Review: I frequent Davio's often for lunch, mostly because it has absolutely scrumptious gluten-free pizza (which is why it made my list of 11 Best Gluten-Free Restaurants in Boston). So when I heard they were adding an extensive gluten-free brunch menu, I jumped at the opportunity to try it out!  Davio's in Boston's Back Bay is a classy place, white tablecloths included. It's perfect for a fancy girl's brunch, a date, or to take your parents to when they're in town.  We started with the Caesar Salad, which was delicious and came with the most scrumptious parmesean crisps. I love how they were generous with the anchovies - for some reason a lot of restaurants skimp out on those, but their salty texture is so great paired with the romaine lettuce!  My sweet tooth was super excited about the gluten-free french toast and berry plate!

It was exactly what we were looking for. First- they have gluten free crusts and vegan cheese. Second - a super wide range of choices and toppings to choose from. A pie can be expensive ($31 for gluten free and vegan cheese) but it seems on par for Boston pricing. Super quick service and the AC is on full blast

Name: Giovanni's Roast Beef and Pizza; Review: Super disappointed in this location. As someone with celiac, finding a pizza shop in the Billerica area that serves any form of a gluten free sandwich or wrap and delivers is incredibly difficult.  I've ordered from Giovanni's twice in the last three weeks and each time they have not had gluten free wraps in stock. I called to cancel the second order today and they told me they do not have them because they have to purchase them. To top it they asked me if I ordered frequently enough for them to order wraps. I told them not to bother, because even if I did it's not reliable.  Please, do not advertise gluten free food as available on your site and not have it in stock. Regardless of whether people order frequently or not, if you advertise having it on your menu and available it should be in stock. There are plenty of non - gluten free items on the menu that I am sure are not ordered frequently that are available

Name: home.stead bakery & cafe; Review: This place is AWESOME! Best bakery I’ve been to in the whole state, and it was just close to my house, the whole time! The food is delicious and fresh, their chocolate cookie chips are awesome. And their hot chocolate? It is better than the Starbucks one and way more cheaper. I ended up staying there for about 2 hours on my day off, I was so comfortable that I didn’t notice the time and yet, no employee made me feel that “you got to leave”. Nope, the employees were naturally nice and friendly. Many people were having different conversations in the bakery, some seemed to talk business and some, school. Oh and, when I left the bakery I forgot something I bought to go, one employee went out, called me in the street holding my cake in the hand. So nice of her considering how the cake tasted so good!  I’m so surprised with the place I discovered, especially considering the really affordable prices. I’ll definitely be going back
Name: Chicked's Chicken & Grill; Review: Went for a quick lunch bite. Nice place!  Inside is clean and inviting.  The owner Dee was working and super friendly!!  I keep kosher and was excited that there was no dairy in the breading for the chicken.  They have amazing fried chicken and they make their bbq and hot sauce in house and it's amazing!!  Two thumbs up
Name: Cafe Madeleine; Review: I was and am looking for bakery products like croissants and bread, Baguettes, pastries, cheese like Gruyere and cold cuts products like salami and prosciutto in the USA similar to those I had living in Europe, Switzerland and I found it in this cute little bakery, Cafe Madeleine. Deliciouse Croissants and the bread, Baguette I will try tomorrow and I am sure it will be as good as I had them in Europe. There is only one other bakery in New York, where I had an excellent almond Croissant, just ""finger licking good"".👌🥖🥐🧀 Thank you cafe Madeleine
Name: El Morro Restaurant; Review: Going in, we were hoping the food quality was going to be the same as the Page Blvd. bakery location.  We were not disappointed....the food was outstanding as always. For fans of the bakery, the prices are a little higher here.  However, the service, nice dining atmosphere, freshness of the food, and unique menu variety make it worth it. Being newly opened...they had the  expected  ""new restaurant"" hiccups.  The food came out a little slow, but not too bad.  And they were temporarily out of some things....like tequila to make margaritas.  However, that brings up another plus...they have a full bar.  And the service was excellent. Would definitely go back","Name: Inna's Kitchen - Boston Public Market; Review: In all fairness, this wasn't quite what we were looking for. We were looking for brunch with GF DF offerings. This is a tiny Jewish deli with very limited seating. Much better suited to take out. I was pleased to be able to order GF DF Challah French Toast, but was disappointed that they were out of the cinnamon swirl. That being said, the Pastrami hash was very good & my family enjoyed their sandwiches & wedge fries.  I'd recommend it for lunch, but not so much for breakfast.  Excellent fresh squeezed OJ was a big plus
Name: Exodus Bagels; Review: I had almost given up on trying to find a bagel in MA that measures up to NY standards. Outside of NY metro area, these are the best bagels I've had. Also the best challah I've ever had from anywhere. Their pandemic setup with online ordering and pickup is very quick, easy and felt safe.  I ordered plain, everything, and dark rye bagels. Pretty much no remaining hole, which is good for sandwiches. Cutting into it, I was surprised to see more/larger air gaps inside than I am accustomed to. But upon eating, it really had the right amount of chew and the crust was just right. It really just tastes like a quality NY bagel. I had practically given up on trying to find a bagel in MA that measures up to NY quality. I've tried Bagelsaurus, Rosenfelds, Iggy's, Bagel World... you name it. All disappointing IMO. After living in Queens for a couple years, I've been spoiled.  The everything bagel was my favorite. For the dark rye, the rye flavor was on the milder side. I could have used a little more, but at least it wasn't overpowering.  I also ordered challah, which you can only get on Fridays, and that was superb. When I first saw it, I was concerned perhaps it was baked too long because it looked a little dark, but it was perfect. Just perfect flavor and texture. Supple but sturdy, excellent crust, sweet but not too sweet. This is one of the few loaves of bread I would not hesitate to pay the hefty $9 price.  I also ordered the chicken liver pate... which is reminiscent of chopped liver but a little different. It's smooth like a pate, and seems to be a bit heavy on the schmaltz and the salt. It's enjoyable, but I'll probably skip this one in the future. It's good and worth a try, but I gotta warn the purists. If you want really good classic chopped liver, IMO you're better off getting it from Michael's Deli or Mahmelah's.  I also got the smoked salmon which was good. It's Acme brand, which IMO is pretty much as good as it gets except for Barney Greengrass and Zabars in NYC. At $12/8oz it's a very fair price, too. You can save a couple bucks getting the 8 oz Nova Pieces at Trader Joe's, which despite the TJ label I'm pretty sure is also sourced from Acme, but this seemed more tender and the slices were bigger pieces
Name: Tatte Bakery & Cafe; Review: This place looks beautiful, and all the pastries delicious.  I got the $4 Chocolate Hazelnut Twist. It looks a picture but I have to take a star off, because doesn't really taste it- the hazelnut is there, but not the chocolate. It tastes more like the end of a batch of cinnamon rolls that got skimped on the filling. Mostly dense pastry to the point it's unpleasant.  I'll still be back to try more. From what I've heard of their other locations, this seems like just a fluke, and not what to expect from their quality.  -  Came back to try more! I tried out their online ordering this time. I ordered two Ham and Cheese Croissants. When I got there around 20 minutes after I ordered (website said it'd be ready in ~15), I didn't find my order on the pick-up shelf. I waited another 5 minutes or so, and watched the staff serve people walk-in pastries, but didn't seem to be aware of my order.  I walked over to the counter to find what I had ordered, and one of the staff helped me. They only had one of the ham and cheese left- he said they must've just ran out when I placed the order. That was disappointing, but he offered to replace it with anything of equal value.  The ham and cheese was delicious, so I can see why it sold out, but at $4.50 each they should have a better system to be sure you are getting what you ordered

Name: Greenhills Irish Bakery; Review: This bakery is great as long as you are getting what you ask for. Everytime i buy a whole pie in this bakery, I always ask the girls if this is freshly made today. If it is yesterdays bake I don't want it. They always say its freshly made today. I'm fed up buying day old pies. They promise it's baked that same day and you take it home and when you cut it you know it's at least a day old. Fresh pastry is nice and crisp, day old pastry is soft and does not taste good. If you sell day old pies that's fine as long as you tell the customer that they are yesterdays bake. But when you are specificially asked if it is today's bake and told yes, but you take it home and it is obviously yesterdays bake when you cut it. It's very aggravating and annoying. I end up throwing the whole pie out. I'm sick of it. Why can't they tell the truth if something is day old then it's day old. LET THE CUSTOMER KNOW. I'm sick of this bakery lying about it's baked pies

Name: Inna's Kitchen - Boston Public Market; Review: DINNER REVIEW  Inna's had been on my list for a while since it served traditional Jewish food in an artisanal food space (the Boston Public Market). I had heard you have to get the shakalatkes (shakshuka plus latkes, a very enticing concept) so I, of course, ordered those plus a falafel pita. Service was quick and we sat down with our food pretty quickly.  The falafel pita was good, the falafel tasted fresh, as did the toppings. I would get that one again. However, the shakalatkes were a little disappointing. I felt like the shakshuka took over the whole thing and it was just the sauce overpowering the soggy patties of potatoes. I think a larger and crispier latke would have provided a better overall eating experience.  I would come back for the falafel, not for the shakalatke

Name: Chicken And Rice Guys; Review: For the price, the taste and portion size are top notch. I've been to the Halal Guys in NY, and maybe because this is a store where they can keep fresh ingredients, but I felt this was much better.  We had the Halal Chicken with rice combo plate, and the chicken was juicy and tender. I also loved the broad sauce selection, which again seemed a great improvement to the packaged sauce that the Halal Guys give you. Here you can douse your plate with bottles of hot sauce (medium or extra spicy), mint chutney, or garlic white sauce. All of them tasted fresh and delicious.  The person working the cash register had some attitude when we were placing our order, so that would be the one thing I'd dock a star for.

Bravo. You have to wear a mask in order to step into this establishment. They've also set up a barrier so that you're at least 6 feet away from the staff.  They are still serving up the same, delicious food. Is it the same as the infamous food cart in NYC? Almost. The thing that sets Halal Guys above all other halal places is that red sauce! It's super hot but doesn't mess up the flavor of your food. You don't have to add much to bring on the heat. I love practically drowning my platters with white sauce and adding at least 4 lines of that red sauce. The beef gyro sandwich is also on point. They really fill it up so you get a full sandwich. I also dig how that pita bread is so soft
Name: Sate Grill-on-Wheels; Review: Best Asian Food Truck!  I love their noodle soups, their Korean BBQ Tofu (I think the meat lovers in the office also love the carnivore BBQ), their salads dishes and their daily specials. Great price value and service, convenient location
Name: The Halal Guys; Review: Yay, so happy now they have franchised and in Boston.  If you do not know about the original location. See the Halal Guys on 53rd and 6th in New York City. One of Yelp's most reviewed locations.  Simple, affordable, tasty.  I like the combo plate and get plenty of sauce to go if you do not plan on finishing it there. Watch out for the hot sauce, it is as it has always been. Not for the ""mild"" hot sauce folks. You should just avoid it all together if you can't take the heat.  As far as I can tell, it is using the same ingredients and because they've franchised it is only as consistent as the food freshness turn over. Granted you're not getting the NYC authentic feeling as you did waiting in line and purchasing a $5 plate of goodness. Recently the cart locations have raised their prices to $8. Boston location's price is about $11 and some change with the tax included. IMHO this is a fair price since they have to pay for rent, and hopefully paying the workers a fair wage, etc.  PS w/o these guys, there wouldn't be a chicken and rice guys, they put halal chicken and rice on the map and main stream, but to be fair chk & rice guys were first to market in Bosto

Name: The Halal Guys; Review: I used to live across the street from a Halal Guys in Chicago so I was happy they have one here in Boston. When you compare it to other fast-casual chains like Cava, Sweet Green, or Chipotle, it's definitely more ""bare bones"" and less fancy. They definitely don't have a ""health"" equity and they don't have many options. But dang this place is delicious. I always get the regular combo platter which comes with beef and chicken, yellow rice, lettuce, and tomatoes. It's also a significant portion for the price which I appreciate.  Servers are friendly but there's not much seating so better to-go than eat-in.  Come in for a quick bite and get the white sauce and a little spicy (it's VERY spicy and I tend to like spicy)  Share review Write an update Edit revie","Name: The Halal Guys; Review: Halal Guys has stepped up their game during this COVID19 pandemic and have made the necessary changes in order to not only keep their customers safe but also their employees!

Name: The Tall Ship Boston; Review: Definitely one of the better views of Boston from the harbor you can find, however in my opinion that’s it. This is essentially like a common area at a festival with food trucks. The drinks were basic and don’t even think of ordering a fancy mixed drink you most likely won’t get that here. The beer selection was ok, probably around 8-10 to choose from. The food really depends on what food truck you choose. Be wary though don’t get any food from the trucks near the entrance. My friend paid 16 for 2 tacos from a truck near the entrance but towards the back they were selling tacos for 5 each. I think I also saw hotdog or sausages for like almost 20, which is insane! Quality-wise the tacos weren’t anything special for 8 each. I also got a fried chicken sandwich and the buns they came with were cold. The chicken itself was decent, at least was tender and not dry. Knowing what I know now, I most likely won’t be returning here. Trying to find parking was one of the worst I’ve ever experienced. Granted it was a Friday night, it took me over 40 mins to find a spot. The lot they have was completely full as well. Not only was it a struggle to find parking, the line to even get in was long as hell. We had to wait until other patrons left to go in. Overall, view is amazing, full of IG worthy spots and the ambiance is nice but that’s it

Name: Chicken and Rice Guys; Review: Good food. Good quantity. Price is good for the amount of food available. Halal chicken is served with rice. It would be better if customers were able to choose between the type of salad they want with their order but overall a good experience

Name: Podima Pizza; Review: I love this place and I try to visit once a week! It is run by two fabulous Palestinian gentlemen, so make sure you get their hummus and shawarma!! Their hummus brings me back to the middle east--nowhere else in the city that does that for me.  Their pizza is also yummy. Everything is also halal

Name: Amsterdam Falafelshop; Review: Awesome Falafel shop now in Kenmore square in addition to their Davis square location.  Finally a place to get good and quick falafels and french fries in town.  I have been waiting for a place like this for a while after going to Maoz and other shops with similar concepts.  The self serve toppings are great and lots of options that I have never seen before but work really well.  The prices are reasonable and this location is bigger then the Davis so there is more space to sit.  Overall a must try if you are craving falafel"
Mediterranean meze restaurants,"Name: BOSTON KABOB COMPANY; Review: The food in this place is the best mediterranean food I had in Boston area, and is better than many places in Israel
Name: BOSTON KABOB COMPANY; Review: The food in this place is the best mediterranean food I had in Boston area, and is better than many places in Israel
Name: Boston Kebab House; Review: Without a doubt, one of my favorite places for lunch in downtown Boston. The food tastes fresh, is more than filling, and has a great balance--for a meat lover, at least.  The lines can be misleading! There are actually three sections to the place. You pick up food upstairs. The leftmost line goes to the salad service side. You DO NOT have to wait in this line if you don't want an entree salad. Go to the right and either order under the huge menu board or use the Meze bar to the right. You pick up your order upstairs between the salad service and the registers. Seating is downstairs. Everything is basically served in Styrofoam lunch containers.  The donor, kofte, and Boston kebab plates are usually what I go for, and while they're not necessarily the best value around, pound-for-pound, they won't leave you disappointed. If you're not hungry enough, I'd recommend going for a smaller item.  Plates go for around $7-$10, gyros/wraps for around $7, salads for around $5-$6, and the Meze is around $7/lb
Name: Dates and Olives; Review: It was my first Mediterranean food in Boston and my wife and I had a very pleasant experience out there. We ordered a chicken sandwich and brown rice bowl with three toppings. My wife pointed out the portion where they seem to be smaller than other Mediterranean restaurants but for me, the quality and freshness of the food were excellent that the portion fits perfect for me. When we visited the place around noon, it was very chill and quiet place to talk with my wife without disturbance. Highly recommend for local people or newcomers to Brookline/ Brighton area who wants to have healthy food with a quick bite. And last but least the Mango Lassi was the finale
Name: Tarboosh (Syrian shawarma & Manakish)شاورما عربي مناقيش مشاوي; Review: Reading five stars reviews made me excited to try this place. We ordered falafel, shawarma and kabab, all were disappointing. You can get better quality food in any American restaurant serve “fast Mediterranean food”. Usually, I am more generous with my rating but what made my experience even more unpleasant is the hygiene part. With hygiene I am not referring just to unclean table but referring to a a dog brought by one of the owner/manager and pet it in front the kitchen area! If you are looking for a quick bite close by it is your place but go with realistic expectation, if you are looking for authentic Mediterranean food this not your place","Name: Zest Mediterranean Grille; Review: Super fresh food, expertly made, in short. I had the  Falafel Plate that comes with three sides. Everything was top-notch. the falafel balls seemed like they just came out of the fryer...still warm and steaming inside. Often at many places these are dry inside. These were moist with a slightly crunch outside, with a delicious flavor, made even more so by the spicy tahini sauce I picked. I had three sides out of what looks like 12 or so choices; a great selection. Everything looked great but I wanted to compare to other places so chose the tabbouleh salad and the fattoush salads, as well as the moussaka. Everything was very fresh with high-quality ingredients IMO. The tabbouleh was delicious, well-balanced and bright with the right amount of lemon juice. The fattoush was delicious and refreshing; I really enjoyed the small amount of mint in it. Finally, the moussaka is something I had not had before. It was delicious with its chick peas and stewed eggplant and tomatoes.  I really appreciate a place like this in general, but especially when traveling when it seems so hard to get fresh, healthy food. This place is a gem. The food and environment is kid-friendly and I can't wait to bring my family back here. Zest, please keep on doing what you are doing!
Name: Mediterranean Grill; Review: Our company orders from here at least once a week, and has been a staple for many years.  Large portions make most meals sufficient for two, excellent customer service always, and consistent quality of food.  Fabulous salads with REAL marinated chicken, fresh greens and veggies, home made soups, great wraps and sandwiches.  Always happy when we go here!  Oh, and they deal with our extras and special orders every time
Name: Dates and Olives; Review: The chicken is always tender and seasoned well, the hummus is perfect, and there are plenty of gluten-free options.  My favorite is a salad bowl in the warmer months, and a rice bowl in the cooler months. There are plenty of toppings to choose from, but it was here I tried muhamara the first time. It's a mix of red pepper, walnuts, pomegranate and spices; I get it every single time. Same with the babbaganoush, which isn't pureed as it is most often, but decent chunks of eggplant and it's my favorite babbaganoush I've tried. The only thing that is a miss is there used to be raw tomato, cucumber and radish which worked well on the salad, but they aren't offered anymore.  They have Sunday brunch too, which the owner is slowly expanding. Back when I was still eating wheat, I would visit frequently to get the French toast, which has a perfect amount of vanilla in the batter.  If you have never had Mediterranean food before, you should try it here! There is a lot to try out, and the staff can make recommendations
Name: Dates and Olives; Review: Welcoming and friendly chef-proprietor with a charming, positive attitude and an interesting, adventurous, international as well as cross-country life and career story to tell. Delicious and beautiful Mediterranean food. Authentic, well-varied dishes, thoughtfully crafted, with distinctive, inventive ingredients and combinations. Very healthy and vegetarian-friendly, too, though also with plenty of meat available. The restaurant is good to sit down in small groups or for takeout, and it has a burrito-bar setup that allows for easy customization.  Well-priced for those with modest budgets, though slightly out of reach for people with very limited incomes. Maybe the owner could add more low-priced sides or samples of their excellent food to cater to every income level, as well as those just looking for a snack. While keeping median price points high enough to stay profitable and in business. Still, without question a great success, full of delicious, authentically Mediterranean, and healthy options, one well-worth visiting
Name: Bishop's Mediterranean; Review: Arrived 5 mins before closing time. Very friendly, smiley staff who took my order to eat in and said I could take my time with my meal - I had the chicken kebab with hummus and fattoush - all very tasty. When I left they gave me a free taster slice of Baklava, which was delicious. Only suggestion is to consider reducing the big plastic packaging for the take-outs","Name: Dates and Olives; Review: Welcoming and friendly chef-proprietor with a charming, positive attitude and an interesting, adventurous, international as well as cross-country life and career story to tell.

Name: Uptowne Mediterranean Restaurant; Review: I found out Uptowne Mediterranean Restaurant by accident. I was shopping in the plaza where it's located and it was lunch time so I wanted to give it a shot. They have great food for really great prices. The chicken and meat shawerma is as fresh as it can be. They cut it off the big rotating skewer and make your meal. The kebabs, appetizers, salads and fixing all are authentic Mediterranean recipes. Lots of Vegetarian choices as well. Falafel, Spinach pie etc. It's a family run business and everyone helping each other and the customers. I started also using them to cater for our company lunches. They make big platters also can make sandwiches. It's the best thing I discovered which reminds me of home. Thanks for your time reading this review

Name: Uptowne Mediterranean Restaurant; Review: It was after 8 pm and we needed something for dinner, but not the usual pizza or whatever. I searched on my phone for ""takeout dinner near here"" and Uptowne Mediterranean came up. I didn't even know it was there, but we always fly past the shopping area at 50 mph.  It's not a fancy place, but it's pleasant, and the owner was very friendly and proud of his food, and made suggestions for next time. The food was marvelous, very tasty, and surprisingly light. The chicken kebabs were delicious, the salad on the side was fresh, and the felafels were among the best I've had","Name: Pita Thyme; Review: I visit Pita Thyme for lunch at least twice a week. They have amazing Mediterranean food. There are several options downtown for Mediterranean food, but I have to say this is definitely the best. Not only is the food rich and flavorful, but they are super quick. They are the perfect pit-stop for lunch downtown.They are reasonably priced (about $8) for the amount of food you get. And if you've ever cooked Mediterranean food, you know that a lot of prep time is required in making this food delicious. Well worth the $8.50 I spend

Name: Andre's Cafe; Review: Conveniently located across from Boston Medical Center, this place serves a lot of folks in scrubs, patients, hospital visitors and local construction workers.  The counter service is friendly and quick and the food is serviceable and includes veggie options. We had the Vegetarian Meze Platter which featured falafel, hummus, grilled eggplant, grape leaves, tabouleh and a bit of green salad with tahini and pita.  The food was nothing special, and the falafel was very dry, but the meal was filling and relatively healthy.  One of the better options (open evenings) in this area

Name: KAVA neo-taverna; Review: KAVA was perfect for a date night, and almost every table on the Saturday night we went was couples. We chose this place for a few reasons. First, we hadn't made reservations anywhere, and KAVA only accepts walk-ins. We arrived around 9, put our name down for a half hour wait, drove around until we found parking, came back and read the menu, and by the time we knew what we wanted to order, we were being seated. Second, they had outdoor seating, and it was a beautiful night. I wouldn't have sat indoors, because the music was way too loud and the place tiny, but they had six two-seat tables outside, and it was a very pleasant corner of the South End to enjoy an open air meal. Third, KAVA had a wide variety of delicious sounding small dishes that satisfied several dietary constraints - gluten free and no red meat. (For the record, the red meat options sounded delicious too, and most of the other tables ordered the braised beef short rib over orzo.) Everything we ordered was delicious. The trio of spreads - tzatziki, melitsanosalata, tirokafteri - was perfect and we put them on everything else we ordered. I especially loved the melitsanosalata, an eggplant salad full of delicious olive oil and herbs. My favorite small plate was the saganaki thalasinon - baked shrimp, mussels, peppers, onion, spicy tomatoes - I lapped up the sauce with the bread. The bread, notably, was the only disappointing part of the meal - cold, a bit stale, and especially disappointing because it was the only intended vehicle for the trio of dips. To drink, I ordered the xinomavri, a full bodied rose that the waiter recommended, and it was perfect with our meal. The waiter was courteous and attentive, and we enjoyed chatting with him a bunch after we finished eating, which he seemed to do at every table. Overall, we had an excellent meal, and we'll definitely be back

Name: Archie's Place; Review: One of the only places in the area to actually get a breakfast with bacon and eggs or French toast.   I love to get the steak tips with rice pilaf and mashed potatoes for lunch. I’m not big on all the Mediterranean stuff that seems to be popping up in the area so Archie’s is one of my go to’s for lunch.  Friendly staff also"
Chinese hot pot spots nearby,"Name: Happy Lamb Hot Pot, Boston 快乐小羊; Review: The soup chain is very consistent and the dishes are the same. However, the store uses a ""single point"" approach, which is somewhat different from Chicago. It is more cost-effective for not eating more consumers, and it will not waste food. However, the sauce must be a little bit different. This part is really different from the general hot pot restaurant, and it is not suitable for a time. Maybe the hot pot itself is quite heavy, although there is no sauce, it seems that there is no problem! The interior decoration is not bad, the location is in Chinatown, the traffic is very convenient! The waiters in the store are almost all Chinese, and there is no problem in speaking Chinese!
Name: Souper Bowl; Review: One of the best chinese food restaurants in Boston. Try it for yourself. If you like authentic chinese food, you would love this place
Name: Joy Luck Hot Pot; Review: If you remember the old Chinatown McDonald's that was here, you will likely be surprised at the extensive renovation that they executed here at this new Chinese restaurant.   There are two menus available, traditional Chinese food, and the 'hot pot' style.   We liked our hot pot very much, food was astonishingly fresh, portions quite large, and the broths intensely flavorful.    Even as a spice fiend, I was challenged by the House Spicy Mala broth - the menu says 'two peppers', but I'd rank it 'five peppers'.   The only complaint was slow and uneven service, and the smoothies are pretty terrible.  With no liquor license, your best beverage option will be soft drinks or water
Name: Happy Lamb Hot Pot; Review: Best hot pot around and the broth is SOOOO delicious. I come here with my family once a week. I used to go to Shabuzen all the time but the broth just does not compare. Also, it’s WAY cheaper! Obviously, more expensive compared to making hot pot at home but I don’t think the price gap is that drastic. I definitely recommend coming here
Name: South Ocean; Review: My family's favorite Chinese food in So. Boston❤️","Name: Tasty Pot; Review: My friends and I were originally trying to go to Happy Lamb Hot Pot in Central Square, but the wait was 1.5 hours, so we quickly Yelped for other good hot pot places without a wait. Tasty Pot was taking reservations on Yelp, and the wait seemed a lot shorter, so we drove over. Our table was ready while we were on the way, so by the time we got there, it was like 20 minutes past when we had gotten the call that our table was ready. There was a line and I thought that they'd make us wait, but they seated us right away without any problems.  We didn't know until we got there that Tasty Pot is Taiwanese style, meaning everyone gets their own individual pot with a bunch of ingredients. There are about a dozen pre-set options with various ingredients, and you can adjust the spice level. I got the ma la beef, which was a bit pricey at $22, but I was very happy with the amount and quality of the food. It was truly spicy though - the edges of my mouth were red and raw by the time I was done!  Would recommend this restaurant
Name: Tasty Pot; Review: This hotspot place is newly open in the area. Went to Boston to visit my cousin who recently moved to the area. It was freezing cold like winter last few days and we were craving something hot and spicy. We want to do hot pot at home, but we're too lazy to do all the purchase and preparation. We searched on yelp and notice this newly open hotpot restaurant just few blocks away. I'm so glad we gave it a try. They are fabulous, variety of food choices and they even have a tofu choice. Cause I'm trying to cooperate more vegetables into my diet and my new favorite food is tofu. And this tofu blends perfectly with the broth. It also came with a bowl of rice but we still order a side of noodle cause I loved noodles. Overall, it was a great experience and I clean the bowl, yes everything in the bowl was clear including the broth

Name: Kaze Shabu Shabu; Review: Nice hotpot, or shabu shabu, spot right on the edge of the busy streets of Chinatown.  Restaurant is very clean and has very spacious seating (particularly when you compare it to the typical crammed seating of any restaurant on Beach st).  Certainly kid-friendly as they had clean high chairs readily available and the waitress was very attentive.  Food-wise, it was filling, tasty, and at a great price point for their lunch specials.  The meats were ok, but the broths definitely made up for it.  We tried the tomyum and tonkotsu.  Both very delicious and flavorful.  If you're in the market to try out a different hotpot restaurant that is a few steps away from the hectic crowds, then give this one a try
Name: Liuyishou Hotpot; Review: Before coming to this place, I read the reviews and noticed people had bad experiences, but as they were just open and I was really excited there is finally an authentic sichuan hotpot place open in Boston , I decided to give a try.  My friends and I arrived at the restaurant around 4:20 pm on Saturday, 10 mins before the restaurant was open. There were already a line, and a couple of people were waiting outside, but not as many. People who were waiting outside were asking the staff to start to distribute numbers, as it was snowing and very cold outside, and the staff agreed to do it. However,  the line wasn't moving at all after 10 mins. When another staff came out, people were asking him how long is the wait time, and he said he didn't know as there is no table available at this point,  because all of seats were reserved. People were confused, as the google reviews say they don't take reservations. So we asked if they take reservations? He said ""No, we don't take reservations, but all the seats are taken."" Then, he just went back inside. We were pretty upset as we thought we could get a table immediately when the restaurant opens as there were not many people waiting in front of us. And who knows how come the tables were taken before the place open without taking reservations??? We turned to another hotpot restaurant nearby immediately after the conversation.

Name: Liuyishou Hotpot; Review: Before coming to this place, I read the reviews and noticed people had bad experiences, but as they were just open and I was really excited there is finally an authentic sichuan hotpot place open in Boston , I decided to give a try.  My friends and I arrived at the restaurant around 4:20 pm on Saturday, 10 mins before the restaurant was open. There were already a line, and a couple of people were waiting outside, but not as many. People who were waiting outside were asking the staff to start to distribute numbers, as it was snowing and very cold outside, and the staff agreed to do it. However,  the line wasn't moving at all after 10 mins. When another staff came out, people were asking him how long is the wait time, and he said he didn't know as there is no table available at this point,  because all of seats were reserved. People were confused, as the google reviews say they don't take reservations. So we asked if they take reservations? He said ""No, we don't take reservations, but all the seats are taken."" Then, he just went back inside. We were pretty upset as we thought we could get a table immediately when the restaurant opens as there were not many people waiting in front of us. And who knows how come the tables were taken before the place open without taking reservations??? We turned to another hotpot restaurant nearby immediately after the conversation. Terrible experience

Name: Joy Luck Hot Pot; Review: The service is excellent and fast:  I don't even have to see the menu, they remember my preferences and every single detail. Unlike other restaurants, the wait persons are very fast in responding. The food is fresh and healthy. The price is reasonable but the portion is big with a good variety of vegetables in the Hotpot combo. The place is spacious, quiet, and bright. You'll also have Classical Chinese music in the background. Not too loud like other Chinese restaurants. They also have big round table to do group hot pots. If you like hot pot, this place is one of the best in town","Name: Liuyishou Hotpot; Review: Liuyishou Hotpot (Japanese style) Store number 1116 newly located at the corner of Kneeland and Washington. I had the pleasure of dining here with a friend who happens to be Asian and a true hot pot enthusiast. So that being said I had to have my best game ready for ordering.  We went with two small individual hotspots since the large hotpot tables were all taken and there was a long wait. This actually was not a bad thing. I really enjoyed having a private hotpot.  We started with the mushroom soup rather than the basic house or spicy which was an excellent decision, it was the bomb!  We basically ordered a ton of food including a couple platters of meat, taro, shiitake mushrooms, home made noodle, pumpkin and a bunch of different vegetables. What a feast. Everything was super fresh and top quality.  In addition to the foods delivered to the table in great fashion, there is a self serve salad/sauce bar which had a great variety of things to mix.  The interior of the location was clean and had a pleasant atmosphere. Definitely a great date place or a place for a group of friends to gather and converse over good hotpot. Parking, well that's another story being at the crossroads of Chinatown and the theater district parking is tough, but you already knew that.  Lol. Thankfully the parking Gods look down on me, I'm always blessed with a metered spot. Kudos to store number 1116. I guess when you open that many locations you really know your stuff

Name: Sichuan Gourmet Billerica; Review: Best Restaurant in Billerica. You might at first be thrown off by this tiny restaurant's appearance, crammed in a tiny strip mall with a liquor store and a laundromat, but don't let that fool you. Sichuan Gourmet has, hands down, the best food in Billerica, and for Chinese food beats any of the Chinatown places I've been to. The trick is to not order typical ""American"" Chinese dishes like Beef and Broccoli or Sweet and Sour Chicken, which are not very good here, -- the dishes you've never heard of are going to be the best.  I should at this point mention that because the cuisine is from the Sichuan region, much of their food is spicy. Unlike many places, when they put those pepper symbols on the menu, they mean it. However, the spiciness is never a raw overpowering burning -- they dishes carefully balance ""Ma"" (a tingly, electric sensation), ""La"" (spicy), and ""Tang"" (a hot burning sensation) with sweet and savory flavors that can convert many people who think they hate spicy food. They aren't just adding cayenne to their dishes like so many other places do. They also have plenty of non-spicy dishes, and are happy to make any of their menu items less spicy.  For spicy dishes, my favorites are the ""Pork and Eggplant with Yu Xiang Sauce"" which appears on their separate specials menu (it has perfect balance of spicy sauce, sweet eggplant, and savory pork), the Dan Dan Noodles (which the waiter should warn you need to be mixed before eating), any of the ""with Spicy Chili Sauce"" dishes (which are meat or fish served in a red spicy sauce with Napa Cabbage), the ""Old Sichuan Chicken"" (a dried fried chicken with an interesting crust -- the house specialty), the ""Gangou Dry Fish Filet"" (similar to the Old Sichuan Chicken but with fish), the ""Sliced Roast Beef & Tendon w. Chili Sauce"" (if you like tendon), and the ""Hot & Sour Wonton Soup"" (listed under ""Sichuan Delicacies"" not ""Soup"", and very different from a typical Americanized Hot & Sour).  For non-spicy dishes, I would recommend the Scallion Pancake (the only Americanized appetizer I would recommend here),""Sichuan Cold Noodles - none spicy"" (cold noodles in a vinegary peanut sauce), ""Sichuan Style String Beans"" (a Sichuan classic, and done very well here), ""Meat Ball Sichuan Style"" (A soup-like hot pot with huge meatballs and lots of vegetables), and the Sesame Sweet Potato Cakes (A hot soft sweet-potato pancake that is stuffed with a sweet bean paste, coated in sesame seeds, and drizzled with a sweet sauce).  This restaurant also has fancier locations in Framingham and Brookline, but the food is much better in Billerica. If you're looking for authentic or spicy food, it's worth the drive

Name: Tasty Pot; Review: Came here on a Friday night around 6:30pm and we added our names to the waitlist. We were seated pretty soon, which was good, as there's not really an area to wait in and we felt kind of in the way (there are shops in the area to walk around when you wait instead). I had the Taiwanese Supreme Spicy Pot (very spicy level) and it was the perfect amount of spice. I really liked the combo of meat, seafood, and veggies in the flavorful broth. At first, it doesn't look like a lot of food, but it's deep, you get rice or vermicelli with it, and it definitely is very filling! I also liked the dipping sauces that you could mix together at the table. I'd like to go back to try the bubble teas as well or some other hot pots, but overall, really good experience

Name: Jook Sing Cafe; Review: This is the best place to eat in Chinatown! The owners are friendly, and the food is too die for! Definitely get one of the clay pot rice dishes... The crispy rice is one of those things you will keep eating long after you are full. You will not be disappointed"
Sushi boat restaurants around here,"Name: Ginza Japanese; Review: Great place for Boston Sushi
Name: LoLa 42 Boston; Review: If I could give negative start, I would. Your overpriced sushi taste similar or worst than a cheap supermarket sushi. You should change your chef, because he/she obviously doesn't know what the real sushi taste like. I would never mind paying the  fancy price for a good food, but let's face the fact that your food doesn't deserve the price. I've been to many upscale sushi restaurants around the world, noting taste as awful as your sushi, especially for the price, 3 rolls + miso soup for $120.. Ridiculous for the quality. I would not pay $5 for your sushi, if I only knew it would be this awful
Name: Basho Sushi; Review: Good sushi good price
Name: WABORA --- Asian Fusion Bistro; Review: I got the Combo A Boat, a side of sashimi octopus, hot Saki and a Sapporo beer. I sat at the bar and viewed my chef preparing my dish and very much approved of his preparation methods. The octopus came out first and was quite fresh and cut correctly. The Saki was the perfect temperature but the glass for the Sapporo was not cold. The boat came out and was prepared very nicely. The spicy tuna had enough heat that didn't overtake the taste. The sashimi was thickly cut and melted in my mouth. The sushi rolls were small but I was able to eat everything as I should have. Quaint place that made it worth the while
Name: Gogo Ya; Review: For Boston, this is top rate Sushi","Name: New Sushi Inc; Review: Kind of a build your own Sushi Bowl place. I think Chipotle, but with sushi. Fish was fresh, sauces were delicious, and my order was accurate. I ordered online, and the pickup was seamless. There's not much seating in the restaurant itself, it shares a spot with a defunct Dunkin Donuts and a sub shop. Definitely not a place you'd want to go if you want to sit down and have a meal, but it's excellent if you want a quick little lunch on your break at work. I'm glad I found it! Definitely get the crispy garlic on top
Name: Douzo Sushi; Review: Another sushi place in my US stay. This place is very close to Boston Back Bay Station, so you can get there very easily and it is not very far from the downtown.  The restaurant is somehow big, when you first enter through two doors, staff will attend you and take you to your sitting. They have both table and lounge areas, so maybe they will ask you which one you prefer, as I was one person I chose to sit down in the bar area.  The bar area has the typical bar, with some tall chairs and small tables for two people ( they can be grouped ) and some TV screens with sports or random stuff.  There are some kinds of Sake and Japanese beer, other than the usual ones. In the menu I only looked for sushi-style food, there are sushi, rolls, maki and sashimi among others.  I chose some with tuna, salmon and yellowfish, and they were very fresh and tasty. It's not the best sushi I've ever had, but it was really good, it was prepared when ordered.  The wasabi was also very good, it mixed really well with the soy sauce and the flavour was awesome, very spicy tho.  The service was also very good, I asked for some advice and what they recommend me was the best ( Yellowfish )
Name: New Sushi Inc; Review: Went here for a quick ""grab n'go"" bite to eat. The shrimp tempura burrito was absolutely delicious! It's a really big portion for the price. The poke bowl was so-so, smaller than the usual for the same price as larger bowls. The location can be a bit confusing and crowded since it's a single building with 3 restaurants side by side, no dividing walls so seating is limited- on a beautiful day take a walk and sit outside instead
Name: T Sushi & Noodles; Review: Although at first it would seem like a very simple sushi stand, you would be surprised by how fresh and tasty their rolls are (Spicy salmon)!! They also have a BOGO 50% off from 4-8 pm. Now I can have a great sushi on a work day

Name: Basho Sushi; Review: Good sushi good price

Name: ZC Boston; Review: Finally had the opportunity to visit this location.  Do note that this review pertains to the sushi only!  One of the nice perks about this location is the free garage parking (2 hours with validation at the front desk of the restaurant) which makes coming here all the easier!  The inside is large and open which is nice and the service we had was prompt (our drinks were always attended to!).  But in regards to the food, the highlight for sure is the 50% off sushi on the weekends!   Yes that's right, the weekends offer half off on most of the sushi there (doesn't include the sushi boats or any market price sushi).  Because of this discount we probably went a bit overboard with the ordering but it was well worth while.  For the special maki rolls I loved the dancing unagi (though I'm favorably biased towards anything with eel in it).  The sushi and sashimi pieces were also surprisingly fresh and they give you nice large cuts (as opposed to the tiny ones you would get a sushi buffets).  They even have uni  (sea urchin) there though the quality is a bit on the meh side.  Overall, the quality you get is a step up from all you can eat sushi buffets so if I have a sushi craving in the future I'll probably come here due to convenience of location and quality for what you pay (especially on the weekends!)"
Popular French creperies nearby,"Name: Grand Tour; Review: We were excited to try this new place but it was unfortunately very disappointing. I’m French and have lived most of my life in France and the food at Grand Tour is not even close to French food sadly... First, it is incredibly overpriced. To give a few examples, the Jambon de Paris was 3-4 slices of thin ham (not Parisian ham at all by the way) at $10. The cheese plate was a selection of 3 New England cheeses (not even French ones) and the 3 pieces were paper thin at $24. We also had the Foie Gras which was tasteless at $22. Tip is also included at 20% for a party of any size (we were just 2 people) which we thought was unusual for Boston. The service was good though. Overall, not a French experience at all. Just a pretentious overpriced restaurant...it was deeply disappointing
Name: Bar Lyon; Review: Overall this restaurant had outstanding French comfort food.I had the burger which was probably one of the best burgers I've had in the last 5 years I normally don't get a burger for dinner but I figured I'd give it a shot and it was boy it was good! Prices were not really cheap it was a moderately priced restaurant. Definitely was hopping when we were there.we plan to go there again soon not sure exactly what I mean it's a fair distance from where we live but it's worth the drive. If you do like true French cuisine I would highly recommend the cassoulet. Overall there's nothing on the restaurant menu that I actually could not recommend. We're big when it comes to French food and I would say everything on there was a winner
Name: Ma Maison; Review: It seems to me that nearly every facet of this restaurant is perfect. 1st they start by bringing fresh French bread to the table with salted cultured French butter.The drink menu is exquisite and the espresso is to die for. With a friend of mine for lunch we ordered the French toast with blueberries, the rattatouille, the him and brie sandwich, and spinach and goat cheese omelet. The French toast is the best that I have had anywhere to date. I have a very sensitive palate and can tell that the bread is soaked in a mixture much like one that would be used for  creme brulee, cooked perfectly, served with fresh blueberries rolled in cream and real maple syrup. The omelette was savory, and tender without being over or undercooked. My companion tells me that the rattatouille was delightful and we shared the ham sandwich later on that afternoon and it was quite delightful and a handy lunch on the go for 2 travelers. The prices might seem a bit high at 1st but are actually quite reasonable for the quality of the food and service. It was a bit warm in the restaurant but seeing that it was over 70ﾟ out that is to be expected. And as soon as I brought that to the attention of the staff they turned on a small air conditioner that was nearby to rectify the situation. I have traveled to this cafe before as it is right by mass general hospital and I see it as a ray of light in an otherwise dismal culinary world

All of the food was great. The drinks were also fabulous","Name: Paris Seaport Bar + Creperie; Review: Popped in on a whim while walking by and we’re glad we did!  Excellent menu selection coupled with excellent service made for a very pleasant experience.  Food was outstanding and portions were very generous, all made with fresh ingredients. Had the pleasure of meeting the owner Henry who was very nice and down to earth. He genuinely cares about the costumers experience. He even had us sample his new lobster bisque which isn’t even in the menu yet.. btw super tasty! Pricing is very reasonable and what you would expect for such quality food. Would highly recommend and we’ll be back for sure
Name: Paris Seaport Bar + Creperie; Review: Hidden gem, and a total gem at that.  It's in an unassuming, fairly weird location under some stairs, but with an active city view out of the glass walls surrounding it. But you won’t need to look outside too long, since you’ve got top notch service inside.  After my second visit there last night, I think this is one of my absolutely favorite spots in Boston. The food is lovely, every bit as delicious as the Brookline location of this creperie, but the cocktails elevate this location over the Brookline one. Brother Cleve helps you feel genuinely welcome, has a deep knowledge of the drinks he crafts (including the ingredients of them), and just helps ensure your experience is wonderful.  I can't recommend this place enough. Easily in my Top Ten in Boston thanks to a tremendous combination of value, flavor, and service
Name: Paris Seaport Bar + Creperie; Review: Came in on a Saturday night, craving dessert! We met the hostess and they said they could have a table cleaned up within the next 5 minutes to seat us. 10 minutes later, the table was cleared off & we were seated and waters were dropped off immediately without the server introducing her name or saying a word. After scrolling though the menu, we were ready to order. I would make eye contact with EVERY SINGLE server and none of them would come by and take our order. I stopped a passing by bartender & asked where our server was because it’s been 20 minutes. After talking to the GODSEND bartender, a server came by and took our order of three crepes. We then waited for the crepes to come out. 20 minutes pass, okay maybe they’re just busy. 30 minutes pass and no update as to where our crepes were. 45 minutes pass and I waved down our sever and asked where our crepes were and she informed me that they were just about to come out & they were swamped. These crepes were not worth the 45 minute wait. Overall, service was extremely slow & the food was decent
Name: Crispy Crepes Cafe; Review: I had a ""basic"" breakfast, but it was delish! The crepes I saw on others' plates looked AMAZING! Wish I would've found this gem sooner in my trip. Would've eaten breakfast, lunch, dinner AND dessert there! Very friendly staff too
Name: Cafe Bonjour; Review: I was excited to check out the newly-opened Cafe Bonjour. Located in a former sewing machine showroom at Temple Place, it is steps from southbound Orange Line trains. The space is cozy, with French subway tile softened by an abundance of historical wood paneling.  The menu is well-designed and the staff kind and accommodating. The cafe manages to comfortably walk the line between classics like croque monsieur, and diet-conscious options. Items are clearly labeled gluten-free, vegetarian. They offer ethically sourced ingredients and plant-based options. Think Gaslight-Tatte-BeGood-Mother Juice mashup.  Of course, you want to know about the food. My charming dining partner had the Mediterranean crepe with spinach and chicken and declared it ""the best thing ever!"" The bit that I sampled confirmed this--it was balanced and satisfyingly savory. I ordered the Montecristo, which was a crepe with goat cheese and ham, generously topped with honey and almonds. It's a tasty and unique option for people who want a treat that is both sweet and salty. After sampling the Mediterranean, though, I had a hankering for some veg on my plate and the staff very kindly whipped up a garden salad side for me.  Add to these items a beautifully made cortado and a perfectly sweetened latte, and our brunchy lunch was complete. Cafe Bonjour is just the sort of lovely place to bring visiting friends--or to get away from the city for a few minutes. A new favorite in the heart of Boston","Name: Frenchie Wine Bistro; Review: Cozy, intimate and warm environment - perfect for lingering over a delicious meal with friends. I haven’t had a meal like this in ages. Frenchie is exactly what a neighborhood bistro should be. We started with cocktails (the frose was perfect) then moved on to wine - you can get a glass of most wines on the menu so we tried three! The escargot toast and foie gras were our favorite appetizers, and the branzino was incredible - salt crusted whole fish, deboned and prepped at the table. I thought I was full but then the desert came. The olive oil cake was beautifully moist and the creme brûlée perfection. Honestly an overall incredible meal in such a beautiful, comfortable space that made French dining feel like a local meal with friends

Name: Petit Robert Bistro; Review: I came here on a date after I mentioned that I had never really had quality French food before. My date made a reservation and it wasn't too busy for 6:30pm on a Thursday night, but we were seated right away. We had the option to sit outside or inside, and we chose to sit outside since it was a nice day and the neighborhood seemed quiet. We ordered the escargots and half a dozen oysters to start, and they were both absolutely delicious. The escargots were flavorful, and the oysters were extremely refreshing. For our entrees, I ordered the scallops and my date ordered the pork. The pork looked like it was breaded, which surprised my date, since he was here last year and it was prepared differently then. It was still tasty, but maybe a tad overcooked. The scallops were cooked perfectly though so I had no complaints! I took off one star for the service since it wasn't the quickest. Overall, I wouldn't mind coming back

Name: Frenchie Wine Bistro; Review: To kick off our dinner, we shared some « escargots », some « coq au vin », and what I consider to be the best Tuna Tartare in town. Everything was so good that we asked for extra bread to finish all the sauce, but please don’t repeat that... But it wasn’t until the traditional « steak frites » cooked medium rare and the home made french fries, which is such a typical french meal, and which was soooo good, that I trully felt like in one of the best French brasserie in Paris. And I’m not done yet... I won’t even get started with the wine and cheese list, because I could write 2000 words only about it and how I almost had tears of joy because of it, but I’d say this: The olive oil cake we had as a dessert is simply the best dessert I had in a very long time, and makes it worth it by itself to put Frenchie on top of your to-dos when you come to Boston. LOVED IT

Name: Cafe Bonjour; Review: For two residents of South Florida taking their first trip to Boston, our main objective was maximizing our short 5 day visit with as much as excursion and warmth as possible. Our tour of Boston was filled with adventure and history at the turn of every corner, and our commutes were alluring as each restaurant we passed by offered a hug and a warming embrace from an ever diverse city with their unique and tantalizing dishes from their respective cultures. The food alone provides visitors with enough reason to plan their return to the city as each restaurant and vendor has an inviting menu and an enticing aroma. On our second to last day, we would stumble upon a blossoming French breakfast cafe where a passionate chef is working tirelessly seven days a week offering a taste of classical French cuisine. A breakfast so good that we would return before our flight home. If you are looking for an excellent meal with a warm and engaging environment, where the owners make you feel like family and serve dishes that will touch your heart, look no further than Cafe Bonjour in downtown Boston (Easily accessible from the orange line at the downtown crossing stop).  When you walk in, the small cozy spot has a calming atmosphere only accentuated by its friendly staff. A small yet abundant menu will offer a selection for any visitor with meatless, gluten-free, and plant based based varieties as well. With an open kitchen, there are no surprises into what owner Driss is serving up on a plate. Attention to detail and sourcing fresh local ingredients combined with the chef's passion for cooking is what makes these French classics stand out. Every dish is made to order and each simple ingredient is prepared right. Moreover, the portions are reasonably priced and will not leave you hungry. Quality over quantity definitely shines in chef Driss's kitchen and it was truly a delight to be served such delicious food.  The dishes we ordered included the Croque Madame Croissant, the Croque Monsieur Baguette, the Fruit and Yogurt Cup, the Signature Blueberry Bowl, the Avacodo Egg White Wrap, the Plant-Based Sausage and Egg Sandwich, and the Bonjour Classic Crepe topped with nutella, strawberries, and bananas. We washed them down with cappuccinos and a plant-based dairy free fruit smoothie called the Serene. The food will speak for itself. I regret not staying longer to try everything. I dare any visitor to find a bad dish on the menu. Thank you Driss and everyone there for making us feel at home and serving us food better than we ever anticipated. We're already looking forward to our next visit. We wish you the best of luck with the business and may the future be filled with great success for you and your family. We made it back to Florida safely. We'll see you all next time

Name: Bar Boulud; Review: Came in for a late lunch on a Saturday to the new Bar Boulud located inside the Mandarin Oriental. First, the location is gorgeous. It has a french winery/bistro feel as some of the walls are covered with what looks like wine cases, nice concept.  I should start with my biggest disappointment though, in what really should have been a highlight, the service... After a great welcome by the manager we sat down and were eventually greeted by our waiter. The only time we saw our waiter from that point on was to take our order and to get the check and offer dessert. When plates were taken after the appetizers we were left without silverware for about 5 minutes into our entree. We were also left without beverages for extended periods of time. This is the kind of restaurant where your glass of water (or any glass) should never be empty. Normally it would warrant a 3 star review but since they've only been open for a week I'm giving them a bit of a pass, but for this caliber of restaurant the service was unacceptable.  The food on the other hand ranged from good to excellent and I would return to try other items I didn't try on my first visit. Here is what I tried:  Rillions - if you've had Latin food before you may have had chicharrón's and these are very similar. These were far superior to any Latin version of the dish I have had before. These fried pieces of pork belly were perfectly crispy on the outside while being juicy on the inside. Perfectly executed and cam with some Dijon mustard that had hints of horseradish.  Shrimps Al Ajillio - Shrimp in a garlic cream sauce. It's as delicious as it sounds. The shrimps tasted fresh and the sauce was perfect for dipping the complimentary fresh sourdough bread they provided. This dish also had a great presentation, I like when food looks like art.  Super Green Spinach - it was super and it was very green. Great side dish, even for someone like me who steers clear of veggies generally. The French know what they are doing.  Croque Madame - House made ham, melted Gruyere cheese on toasted white bread with a béchamel sauce. Topped with a farm fresh egg. This dish was not only heavenly and rich but the presentation was gorgeous. For those not familiar with french cuisine I would compare it to a lunch croissant in terms of its flavor profile.  Frenchie Burger - topped with tomato mustard and confit pork belly, which I found to be more or less similar to bacon. It came with a side of fries and was cooked perfectly. The burger, like all the other dishes, had a great presentation. While the burger was perfectly good, I've had better in this price range.  Macaroons & Chocolates - Small dessert plate for about $6 that has 2 small pieces of chocolate and 2 mini macaroons. A good ending for someone with a sweet tooth who may be starting to get full","Name: Crispy Crepes Cafe; Review: I had a ""basic"" breakfast, but it was delish! The crepes I saw on others' plates looked AMAZING! Wish I would've found this gem sooner in my trip. Would've eaten breakfast, lunch, dinner AND dessert there! Very friendly staff too

Name: Lady M Cake Boutique; Review: Glad to see Lady M opening a store in Boston! The skip is clean and simple. Nice cake display. Nice packaging. The crepe cakes were superb, especially the green tea and the red bean flavors. The crepes were so thin, and the filling makes the cake tastes like heaven. The Mont Blanc was excellent too. The strawberry shortcake and other cakes were just OK, not bad, but for the price of $8-$9 per slice, I am expecting more in terms of quality, flavor, texture, and creativity. Service was OK, not bad, but not that friendly eithe

Name: Frenchie Wine Bistro; Review: To kick off our dinner, we shared some « escargots », some « coq au vin », and what I consider to be the best Tuna Tartare in town. Everything was so good that we asked for extra bread to finish all the sauce, but please don’t repeat that... But it wasn’t until the traditional « steak frites » cooked medium rare and the home made french fries, which is such a typical french meal, and which was soooo good, that I trully felt like in one of the best French brasserie in Paris. And I’m not done yet... I won’t even get started with the wine and cheese list, because I could write 2000 words only about it and how I almost had tears of joy because of it, but I’d say this: The olive oil cake we had as a dessert is simply the best dessert I had in a very long time, and makes it worth it by itself to put Frenchie on top of your to-dos when you come to Boston. LOVED IT

Name: Cafe Bonjour; Review: I was excited to check out the newly-opened Cafe Bonjour. Located in a former sewing machine showroom at Temple Place, it is steps from southbound Orange Line trains. The space is cozy, with French subway tile softened by an abundance of historical wood paneling.  The menu is well-designed and the staff kind and accommodating. The cafe manages to comfortably walk the line between classics like croque monsieur, and diet-conscious options. Items are clearly labeled gluten-free, vegetarian. They offer ethically sourced ingredients and plant-based options. Think Gaslight-Tatte-BeGood-Mother Juice mashup.  Of course, you want to know about the food. My charming dining partner had the Mediterranean crepe with spinach and chicken and declared it ""the best thing ever!"" The bit that I sampled confirmed this--it was balanced and satisfyingly savory. I ordered the Montecristo, which was a crepe with goat cheese and ham, generously topped with honey and almonds. It's a tasty and unique option for people who want a treat that is both sweet and salty. After sampling the Mediterranean, though, I had a hankering for some veg on my plate and the staff very kindly whipped up a garden salad side for me.  Add to these items a beautifully made cortado and a perfectly sweetened latte, and our brunchy lunch was complete. Cafe Bonjour is just the sort of lovely place to bring visiting friends--or to get away from the city for a few minutes. A new favorite in the heart of Boston

Name: Ma Maison; Review: I have never eaten french food before, this is my first time. So I can't really compare or say if it's really authentic french food. I also come from Italy so I know the value and taste of good food from europe. I can say this was one of my best food experiences in Boston. I liked every dish I tried, like the escargots, coq au vin, crepes, fois gras and the creme brulee as the dessert. Everything was very testy, delicate and also nice to look at. I had some sauvignon blanc in carafe as wine and it also was very good. I liked that they bring you the baguette bread as much as you ask and it comes warm as freshly baked with some butter. The dishes have a lot of sauces, especially the escargots, so it is a shame to waste all that goodness without doing ""scarpetta"" with the bread. The waiters also were very nice and always ready to help us.  Overall I had a very good experience, I liked the food and I felt good during my stay there. Good job to everyone, I will definitely come again to try more french cuisine!! :"
Korean BBQ delivery options,"Name: Sate Grill-on-Wheels; Review: Best Asian Food Truck!  I love their noodle soups, their Korean BBQ Tofu (I think the meat lovers in the office also love the carnivore BBQ), their salads dishes and their daily specials. Great price value and service, convenient location
Name: Grassroots Cafe; Review: Working in the building, I walked past Grassroots literally thousands of times before I finally tried it.  And when I finally did, I realized I had been missing out.  It's a very, very small nook on the outside wall of a building, specializing in Korean food.  They have some standard lunch sandwiches, but the reason to go to Grassroots is for their Korean Fusion menu board.  The east west pig sandwich comes with a few big pieces of slow cooked pork covered in a spicy Asian sauce, complimented with onions, cheese, tomato, and lettuce.  Even prepared as ""mild"", it's spicy, so beware.  The vegetables cool down the spiciness and savoriness of the pork, the cheese gives it a creamy layer of texture, and the big bulkie roll holds it all together.   The roll never gets soggy.  The KBM (Korean Bahn Mi) is an excellent take on the Vietnamese classic, with a Korean twist.  It has all the usual suspects of a good bahn mi, but the meat is slathered in a tasty Korean BBQ sauce.  The bread is softer than I prefer in a bahn mi, but it didn't detract from the taste and it didn't get soggy.  The staff is always welcoming, polite, and fast.  Prices are just barely of the higher end, but it's worth it
Name: Korean Asian Kitchen - Mission Hill Roxbury; Review: Spicy and normal soy-garlic wings were great, delivery (third party) was fast (food was prepared quickly.) five stars to offset whatever reason there's a one star. would order again when i'm in the mood for korean
Name: The Smoke Shop BBQ - Seaport; Review: Great restaurant in multiple regards. The BBQ itself is flavorful and good. It's hard to find good BBQ in Boston, and while I'm sure this isn't the same as the pit bosses make in the south, it definitely holds its own! I like the way they do their flavors. I know there are many styles but I prefer mine more smokey with a spice kick and a hint of sweet. I don't care as much for the very sweet BBQ sauces. They do their BBQ the way I like it, with just the right amount of a little kick that wont knock you over, so don't worry if you don't like spicy. I got the burned ends dish and it was very flavorful. It comes with a choice of 2 sides. The mac n cheese could've been creamier but that's my one little ""complaint"" as far as food quality goes. I don't know much about whiskey, but if you like whiskey they have a lot to choose from. The dishes are expensive for what you get, which is to be expected of BBQ but the portions were a bit on the small side, but still satisfying. The staff was GREAT. They did what they could to get a table ready for me and my wife. I never felt rushed with the order even though they were busy and the waiter answered all my questions and was polite. They even gave us a free cocktail that they accidentally made for someone else! Parking is difficult and not recommended but if money isn't an issue you'll find garages. The easiest way to get here is to take the T to South Station, walk over the bridge to the seaport district and head north one block to Congress street. Only about 1/2 mile walk. I recommend the Smoke Shop BBQ
Name: Seoul Jangteo; Review: One of the best authentic Korean food restaurant in all of Boston. Their traditional take on pork gukbap (Pork broth, meat and rice soup) and Jjajangmyun (one of the most popular noodle dish in South Korea) along with speacialty dishes you can’t find anywhere else in Boston make them one of the most authentic Korean restaurants in all of Boston. Their broth dishes will literally melt your soul away during the cold Beantown winters and give you a health boost after having this dish. I am a foodie myself and proud to be a Korean American who have been living in both worlds for a good amount of time in my 29 years of age and I must say that Seoul Jangteo has truly made me happy knowing that I can get authentic traditional korean dishes in Boston. Five stars all the way and recommend this restaurant to all food lovers. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ 🍛🍲🍜🍚🍶","Name: BBQ Chicken; Review: We stumbled across bb.q a few days after it opened when its menu was still half unavailable. It didn't matter. The chicken was phenomenal. GO HERE! Easily the best Korean fried chicken we've had in Boston. Incredibly cheap for the price, with generous portions at 10 pieces for ~$11. We tried their Secret Spicy and the Gang-Jeong, and both were wonderful in their own right (and perfectly cooked). But the real star came on a repeat visit when we got the Hot and Spicy (which was not on the menu the first time we went). We were hoping for spicy chicken and GOOD GOD we were rewarded. This was incredibly spicy and it didn't matter one bit. The chicken was moist and incredibly flavorful, and the sauce hit that perfect note of sweet, savory, and searingly spicy. This is really not chicken for the faint of heart, but for those feeling brave, give it a shot. It's wonderful.  Can't wait to get more from them
Name: Korean Asian Kitchen - Mission Hill Roxbury; Review: This is my 4th time ordering food from this place. The food I don't have a problem with, I like it a lot and its a 5 star for me. But the people here are ALWAYS forgetting something in my orders. I even write down the notes on uber eats to please don't forget the utensils and they still manage to forget them. Just order now, and they didn't bring kimchi, when I even add extra kimchi to the order. They didn't send the korean chilly sauce. Maybe will only order for pickup next time to make sure everything is there
Name: BBQ Chicken; Review: I've dined-in and delivered maybe 15 times or so ever since it's open, and it's chicken quality has gotten progressively worse that I have stopped going to it altogether, despite loving Korean chicken. The chicken almost tastes like they boiled them first and then refrigerated them - does not smell or taste fresh. In fact, the chicken meat actually smell like they are old chicken meat... If you have left overs, don't think about reheating and eating them even if you refrigerated them right away... the smell and taste will compare to a week old fried chicken from somewhere else. I've also gotten sick after eating chicken from here a couple of times over the last several tries. Not recommended anymore.  닭 누린내 점점 너무 나요
Name: Quic Pic BBQ; Review: Large portions of delicious food at a very reasonable price! There are a ton of different options on the menu, and the meat is always juicy and flavorful. I usually get the 3-meat combo with Peking duck, scallion chicken, and crispy pork. The vegetable side changes from day to day, but is usually either cabbage or broccoli (also yummy). If you eat in, a bowl of soup is also provided. There is often a line, but it moves very quickly, so if you're hoping to get take-out you can get your food easily in 5-10 minutes maximum. As the shop name suggests though, this place is decidedly not for vegetarians. Would highly recommend dropping by for some of the best (in my opinion) Chinese BBQ in town

Friendly service and a salad bar I can only describe as ""generous."" Really thoughtful and unexpected options (add a kimchi dumpling, some roasted zucchini or any number of prepared egg, pasta, lentil, etc. salads to your to-go container). As a vegetarian, I appreciate all the options to have a delicious, healthy lunch.  Their hot meals (bibimbap, tofu and rice with veggies, etc.) are enough for two meals.  Everything comes at a nice price and with friendly service.  Servic

Name: OliToki; Review: Definitely go with friends so you can order a lot and share. Great prices, speedy service, outstanding value. When you need a little variety in your tacos, Korean fusion is the way to go. I wasn't quite sure how it would turn out the first time I ate there and my fears disappeared immediately. I usually go for the tacos with chicken, but the seasoned pork and bulgogi beef are worth having. The burritos are out of this world with bacon fried rice & kimchi, and both the totchos and ramen-seasoned fries are a must-try. (Ignore the ketchup packets with the fries.) And the kimchi rice balls are perfect for fans of arancini

Name: Suishaya; Review: Friends of mine took me once to this place, with Korean and Japanese styles dishes, inside Chinatown hood.  If you look for a fork, knife or spoon, don't look for them, it's supposed to use your provided chopsticks and in case you order something that it's mandary in order to help eating it, they will be provided.  This was my first Korean restaurant in the US, so I declined their Sushi section in the menu and I headed to the Korean dishes.  First of all, you'll get some apetizers as red beans, bean spouts, carrot with chilli.  First time I tried Okdol Bibimbap, it came in a really hot pan, with all the ingredients ready to be cooked in it and a small recipient with spicy sauce. You have to be fast and start mixing it to don't get your food burnt. I ordered it with spicy pork, so it was spicy and very hot, it took me more than half hour to finish it, the amount of food also was big tho. My experience was food, the food, service and the local were good.  The second time I had Jam Bang with Korean noodle, also a big bowl came to the table, with the usual thick Korean noddles, mussels, shrimps and a selection of vegetables. As it was raining it was the perfect choice, it was both hot and spicy. The noodles and the soup were tasty and flavourful, I usually don't eat soup but this one it was really worth it.  As I came with some friends both times I tried Bulgogi Beef, that was pretty good.  The only bad things is they don't have beer nor home made tea, so don't expect anything good for drink.  The second time the fire alarm was triggered as some dishes are really hot and smoke comes out of them, but it's a mere anecdote

Name: Saté Grill Cafe; Review: Love it! It's my staple-lunch while working downtown. Super fast, friendly staff, and a great price point. When it doubt, try the Bulgogi Beef on Egg Noodles

Name: kimchipapi kitchen; Review: Super busy place even during a pandemic (which is great for them) because it's in a college area. Called to order food on a Sat night around 730pm. Person on the phone said it was a 35min wait for food. No problem. Went in 35mins later and the food weren't ready yet. They had so many orders for ubereats. So my order wasnt actually ready until closer to 1hr later when the call was made. My bf waited inside the restaurant while i watched the car and the location is hard to find parking so that was my worry. If we knew it would take longer than 35mins to wait for the food, we wouldn't have come here sooner just to wait. Called around 730pm and got the food closer to 830pm. Not really a big deal since i understand they're busy but this is our first experience with the restaurant. Will know better next time not to come too early to pick up food.  Ordered food for 3ppl (2 corn dogs, crab salad, 3 bowls). We like and enjoy the food. Our first time eating korean street corn dogs. We were excited for it and it did not disappoint for take out (would taste even better if eaten fresh out the fryer). The only i didnt like was that my kimchimama bowl because they added way too much sauce. Had way too much gochuchang sauce (high acidity) for me. Couldnt even finish half of my bowl. Other 2 bowls had the right amount of sauce on it. Overall, we still enjoy the food and would definitely come back to try other foods but probably just not on a weekend night"

Name: Symphony Sushi; Review: Every time I go to a new restaurant, I try to find the menu item that'll be my go-to in the future. Symphony Sushi is very close to where I live, and it has been for years now, so of course it has preference over other sushi places for that reason. Time and time again I've tried to find something, anything on the menu that I think is actually worth ordering again. I haven't found a single thing. I've ordered something different almost every time I've gone, and nothing has taken my heart. Everything has been perfectly mediocre. I hate to talk about my exes, but back in Albany I had a sushi place called Sushi Tei that I was absolutely smitten with. The prices were good, and the sushi was so tasty it was unreal. But Albany isn't known for its sushi, so I figured a city like Boston would have its standards a lot higher, right? Symphony Sushi hasn't given me anything that's measured up, despite my many attempts to give it another chance. If you're just craving sushi in general and you're local like I am, this is your place. But if you want something with more substance, something that'll actually wow you, you'll have to look elsewhere. I'm sorry. :
Name: LoLa 42 Boston; Review: If I could give negative start, I would. Your overpriced sushi taste similar or worst than a cheap supermarket sushi. You should change your chef, because he/she obviously doesn't know what the real sushi taste like. I would never mind paying the  fancy price for a good food, but let's face the fact that your food doesn't deserve the price. I've been to many upscale sushi restaurants around the world, noting taste as awful as your sushi, especially for the price, 3 rolls + miso soup for $120.. Ridiculous for the quality. I would not pay $5 for your sushi, if I only knew it would be this awful","Name: Fin's Sushi & Grill; Review: I come here almost every week because I work across the street and am a sushi addict. if you like salmon (not spicy salmon bc that's pretty much the hot dog of salmon sushi), you need to try their salmon. it's so fresh, it's unbelievable. pretty much melts in your mouth. best salmon I've ever had in Boston hands down...without paying an arm and keg. lunch specials are great if you get the bento box option. it comes with a decent sized entre along with a salad, two pieces of California roll, an egg roll or shumai and fruit
Name: SADO Asian Fusion - Boston Asian Fusion; Review: Went for dinner last week and loved the food! The sushi is a tad pricier than surrounding places, however you get what you pay for as the sushi at Sado is better quality. The beef teriyaki was great as well, juicy and tender and right out of the kitchen as it was still steaming hot when it arrived at the table. The lunch specials seem to be good so I will most likely get a sushi special in the future. Highly recommend!
Name: No Relation; Review: A ""hidden"" sushi bar inside of a tiki bar? Two white guys slinging fusion sushi? I was intrigued enough to take one for the team and drop $95 on a ticket, but I went in with very, very low expectations.  I'm happy to report that No Relation delivered in just about every way. The meal was a pleasure and I would (will!) certainly visit again.  Upon arriving at Shore Leave, we were taken through the bar and to the back, down a fairly long hallway that acts as a nice delineation between the noise of the outer bar and the relative serenity of the sushi experience. The sushi bar itself is a small and fairly sparse room. Just a bar, around 10 seats, some bottles on the wall, and a bit of room for staff to move around. Color and decoration, while minimal, supports and focuses the sushi bar theme nicely, and the overall impression is fairly elegant -- again, surprising for the back of a tiki bar.  We were presented with menus listing what we'd be eating -- a nice touch, although I would rather have received the menu at the end, as I enjoy a bit of a surprise -- and the two chefs began working on our meals. The chefs, while friendly and more than willing to answer questions, were not quite as exuberant as many chefs I've encountered when dining omakase style in the past. Not necessarily a minus, but just something worth noting.  Our 14 courses consisted of 11 pieces of nigiri, a handroll, a ""sashimi"" course, and a soup (a Japanese-influenced nod to clam chowder) to finish. Of these I would say that almost all were great to excellent.  One of the pieces I was especially worried about as a sushi traditionalist, ""Ocean Trout with Flavors of Thailand,"" turned out to be one of the best of the night. The ""flavors of Thailand"" -- a concentrated dollop of paste on top of the piece -- provided a nice pop and yet were subtle enough to not overpower either the fish or rice.  Other stand outs included a deliciously fatty marinated chutoro with fried shallot, an amazingly tender and very large scallop featuring brown butter, striped jack with Maine uni and Maui onion (another one I was concerned about going in), and sea bream with cherry blossom.  The only course I found somewhat disappointing was the sashimi of horse mackerel, which was presented sauced and wrapped in cucumber. Mackerel is one of my favorites, and I found it to be completely overpowered by its accompaniments.  I also opted for the $60 beverage pairing. My pairing included two sakes, a Champagne, a rose, and an amontillado to finish. Both of the sakes were interesting and appropriate -- the first off-dry to compliment some of the more focused flavors at the beginning of the meal, and the second quite a bit drier, which worked nicely with the fattier courses. The Champagne I found to overpower the course it was served with, and while the rose faired better, it wasn't quite a perfect match. The sherry, which I'm guessing was mostly intended to pair with the final course of ""clam chowder,"" was interesting and something I'd like to try again with sushi. But overall I'd not recommend the pairing based on my experience. While I think the choices were thoughtful, I think I'd have been happier ordering a bottle or two of sake a la carte.  All in all, a very nice sushi experience, walking the line quite adeptly between tradition and fusion. A great addition to Boston's rather limited selection of upscale sushi offerings, and one that I hope will stick around for the long run
Name: Douzo Sushi; Review: Another sushi place in my US stay. This place is very close to Boston Back Bay Station, so you can get there very easily and it is not very far from the downtown.  The restaurant is somehow big, when you first enter through two doors, staff will attend you and take you to your sitting. They have both table and lounge areas, so maybe they will ask you which one you prefer, as I was one person I chose to sit down in the bar area.  The bar area has the typical bar, with some tall chairs and small tables for two people ( they can be grouped ) and some TV screens with sports or random stuff.  There are some kinds of Sake and Japanese beer, other than the usual ones. In the menu I only looked for sushi-style food, there are sushi, rolls, maki and sashimi among others.  I chose some with tuna, salmon and yellowfish, and they were very fresh and tasty. It's not the best sushi I've ever had, but it was really good, it was prepared when ordered.  The wasabi was also very good, it mixed really well with the soy sauce and the flavour was awesome, very spicy tho.  The service was also very good, I asked for some advice and what they recommend me was the best ( Yellowfish )
Name: Fin's Sushi & Grill; Review: This place was amazing , I went here for dinner and it makes all other food look horrendous! I got the sushi deluxe and it was great! for an appetizer I got a miso soup, seaweed, iced tea (best I`ve ever had.), and six pieces of sushi with 12 other pieces of sushi that was made differently though, for dessert I had a strawberry mochi ice cream which was gone in less than five seconds, and the last part was the little mint.

Other stand outs included a deliciously fatty marinated chutoro with fried shallot, an amazingly tender and very large scallop featuring brown butter, striped jack with Maine uni and Maui onion (another one I was concerned about going in), and sea bream with cherry blossom.  The only course I found somewhat disappointing was the sashimi of horse mackerel, which was presented sauced and wrapped in cucumber. Mackerel is one of my favorites, and I found it to be completely overpowered by its accompaniments.  I also opted for the $60 beverage pairing. My pairing included two sakes, a Champagne, a rose, and an amontillado to finish. Both of the sakes were interesting and appropriate -- the first off-dry to compliment some of the more focused flavors at the beginning of the meal, and the second quite a bit drier, which worked nicely with the fattier courses. The Champagne I found to overpower the course it was served with, and while the rose faired better, it wasn't quite a perfect match. The sherry, which I'm guessing was mostly intended to pair with the final course of ""clam chowder,"" was interesting and something I'd like to try again with sushi. But overall I'd not recommend the pairing based on my experience. While I think the choices were thoughtful, I think I'd have been happier ordering a bottle or two of sake a la carte.  All in all, a very nice sushi experience, walking the line quite adeptly between tradition and fusion. A great addition to Boston's rather limited selection of upscale sushi offerings, and one that I hope will stick around for the long run

Name: Douzo Sushi; Review: Another sushi place in my US stay. This place is very close to Boston Back Bay Station, so you can get there very easily and it is not very far from the downtown.  The restaurant is somehow big, when you first enter through two doors, staff will attend you and take you to your sitting. They have both table and lounge areas, so maybe they will ask you which one you prefer, as I was one person I chose to sit down in the bar area.  The bar area has the typical bar, with some tall chairs and small tables for two people ( they can be grouped ) and some TV screens with sports or random stuff.  There are some kinds of Sake and Japanese beer, other than the usual ones. In the menu I only looked for sushi-style food, there are sushi, rolls, maki and sashimi among others.  I chose some with tuna, salmon and yellowfish, and they were very fresh and tasty. It's not the best sushi I've ever had, but it was really good, it was prepared when ordered.  The wasabi was also very good, it mixed really well with the soy sauce and the flavour was awesome, very spicy tho.  The service was also very good, I asked for some advice and what they recommend me was the best ( Yellowfish )

Name: Fin's Sushi & Grill; Review: This place was amazing , I went here for dinner and it makes all other food look horrendous! I got the sushi deluxe and it was great! for an appetizer I got a miso soup, seaweed, iced tea (best I`ve ever had.), and six pieces of sushi with 12 other pieces of sushi that was made differently though, for dessert I had a strawberry mochi ice cream which was gone in less than five seconds, and the last part was the little mint. I would have to really recommend this restaurant to anybody.  ~~~~~~ 有り難う~~~~~","Name: Crazy Stone; Review: Crazy Stone has some of the best sashimi I've had in a while! I will definitely be going again and trying some of their special rolls, but I think the quality of sashimi is the most important when looking for a sushi spot. They also have a full menu, with entrees from tempura, and teriyaki to wok and grill, as well as soups, salads, noodles, and of course what generally comes last, desserts.  I will definitely be getting Crazy Stone takeout this winter, and I look forward to sitting down to a boat of sushi with friends at a table overlooking the pond in the summer

Name: Basho Sushi; Review: Very good sushi and a great place

Name: State Street Sushi; Review: Brand new sushi place that know what they're doing. Amazing sushi at a low price and convenient spot

Name: Ginza Japanese; Review: Great place for Boston Sushi"
Greek souvlaki spots nearby,"Name: Campus Trolley; Review: The menu is made up mostly of wraps, but there are some platter options. I had the greek chicken roll up - chicken and vegetables wrapped in pitta. Comes with feta cheese and greek dressing. $6 for the sandwich and they only accept cash
Name: Boston Kitchen Inc; Review: One of my favorite spots to grab something to eat. fantastic location, neat, and excellent service. Keep it up
Name: Primo Pizza Restaurant; Review: We tried this place twice. The first time was terrible so we went back again and we had the same experience. The salad was filled with old, brown lettuce, the pizza tasted like a frozen pizza, and the subs are, at best, mediocre. I would not recommend wasting time at Primo's especially when there are other phenomenal spots right nearby
Name: Bhop - Boston House of Pizza; Review: I try to get here once or twice a week.  It's a short walk from the office.  They have a good style that's sort of Greek but sort of New York style pizza. They have avoided the greasy Greek model.  They also keep a variety of interesting pizza types ready to serve through the lunch rush.  Good stuff
Name: KAVA neo-taverna; Review: DINNER REVIEW  After living in Boston for 9 months and hearing so many good things about Kava, I finally found an opportunity when my mom was in town (we both love Greek food). They don't take reservations so that had been a deterrent up to this point. But we were in no rush and were willing to go put our name in early so that's what we did.  We got there at 6:30 PM and put our name in...they said it would be 30-45 minutes so we went to grab a drink at Banyan nearby. This place is so small that you cannot grab a drink here...all the bar seats will be full with drinkers or diners. After an hour, we decided to go see where we were on the list and they said there was one party ahead of us but that there were two bar seats available. Bar seats are first come, first served and we don't mind sitting at the bar so that's what we did.  TIP: Be prepared to wait. Luckily it's worth the wait and there are tons of places nearby to grab a drink. Or just walk around the South End and admire the beautiful homes.  SETTING: This place is tiny (maybe only 40 seats or so) which makes it very intimate. You can easily hear the conversations of your neighbors. It's dimly lit and has rope accents everywhere (the lights hang from ropes, the bar shelves hang from ropes etc.). There's an old Greek guy painted on the wall. Love the decor here.  SERVICE: Our server was courteous and attentive. Zero complaints.  FOOD: The menu is made up of small plates, meant to share, and it's not too big, which makes decisions a bit easier. That said, it has quite a diverse menu so you will definitely find something you like. All the menu items are in the original Greek with descriptions below which add to the authenticity of the meal. The bread is some of the best bread I've had at a restaurant so even if you're on a ""gluten-free"" or ""paleo"" diet, try this with some olive oil and you won't regret it.  Here is what we ordered, in order of what I would recommend to others. Even so, I would recommend everything we got to get again but I would, of course, like to try some different things when I go back.  Kolokithakia (zucchini chips with tzatziki) - HOW!? I demand to know how they make this. Kava owners, if you are reading this, please message me how you make these bites of heaven. I have had zucchini chips before but not like this. First of all, they come served like a blooming flower, held up by the delicious tzatziki on the bottom. They are a little puffy but so light and the fried portion does not come off the zucchini portion AT ALL. The zucchini is tender and warm but not disintegrating into mush. 100% would get this again.  Paidakia (grilled lamb chops with fries) - If you don't eat meat...it's okay, they make lamb! These are just classic Greek lamb chops prepared with olive oil, oregano, and lemon. We ate these with our hands and had no shame about it. Definitely on the pricier side ($38) for the amount of meat you get but delicious. Fries were good to dip in the leftover tzatziki from the above!  Horiatiki (Greek salad with tomatoes, cucumbers, bell pepper, feta etc.) - these tomatoes were some of the best-tasting I've ever had. This is a nice, light salad to balance out the meal with some of the heavier meat you will order.  Oktapodi (grilled octopus) - Can't go wrong with grilled octopus. They come in little slices so no cutting necessary.  TIP: Greeks are not known for their desserts and they only really have a dessert of the day (in this case, baklava) and greek yogurt with berries. Go elsewhere for dessert.  Can't wait to come back to Kava","Name: Zo Greek Cuisine; Review: Zo is one of my two go-to places for gyros.  Both of their brick-and-mortar locations, and their food truck, have some of the best gyros you'll find in the area.  My favorite is the ""original"":  pork gyro meat with tomato, onion, and tzatziki wrapped in a soft pita.  The meat is that salty and savory, complimented by the brightness of the tomatoes and onions.  Everything is pulled together and cooled down with a smothering of tzatziki.  These gyros are messy.  Don't bring a first-date here unless you want to look like you're incapable of feeding yourself.  On your way out, stop at CVS and pick up a roll of paper towels just so you can keep your composure while you feast.  Service here is *fast*.  If there's a line out the door, don't let it deter you... they fly through the line.  There is extremely limited seating in all of the locations, it's meant to be a takeout place
Name: Saloniki Greek; Review: Just tried Saloniki for the first time and I am very happy that it's a part of the Fenway community! I got their Herc pita, while my friend got the Niko pita. We split a lemon curd on the side as well.  The Herc's feta spread had the perfect amount of spice. The fresh vegetables complimented the honey pork very well. I think the best part might have been the crunch of the Greek fries (similar to slimmer potato wedges). There's nothing like a freshly made pita either.  The lemon curd mixed really well with the yogurt base. I only had a few bites and still found it to be quite decadent and filling. I'm particular about greek yogurt too, but this kind was top notch.  I can't wait to go back
Name: Saloniki Greek; Review: You know, it's not the most authentic, but that doesn't mean it isn't good. I had the George pita, and it was really killer! Loved it. The atmosphere in the restaurant is nice, and I love dining in as opposed to getting takeout from this place. The staff are nice and helpful, but they're mostly clueless young kids, so you have to give them some time to ask around if you have any serious questions (as a clueless young kid myself, I'm glad Saloniki is employing them, but maybe having at least one veteran staff member at the restaurant at all times would be a good idea). Don't go here if you're looking for traditional avgolemono or anything, but if you're looking for a killer pita and fries, this is your spot
Name: Mykonos European; Review: There is no better spot for your gyros. That's a guarantee. I've been coming here for over 15 years and so have my family members and friends. They actual season their hamburger meat for their burgers and those are also amazing. Do not waste your time trying a gyro elsewhere..this is where it's at
Name: Gyro City; Review: Opa!!! Gyro City is in my opinion is the best fast food Gyro maker in Boston. Close to Fenway Park I find often times coming here for a pregame Gyro and then walk to the Red Sox game.  Lovers of the Gyro sandwich with fries stuff inside as sold in the villages of the Greek Isles are made that way here so you've found the place that will put craving to rest. Each Gyro is stuff with fries & tyitszicki , lettuce & slices of tomato on a fresh pita. Mixed with those ingredients will be some sorta roasted flesh of your choice or a souvlaki stick ( chicken or pork ) to accompany those fixings inside the pita. The other Gyro meat is the lamb/beef combo swirling giant meat posts roasting for the gentleman to shave it off for your sandwich. Outside of that there's a few more items including salad and soup for ordering but the main item aka the rock star item is the Gyro Sandwich.  Feta fries are a nice tasty accompaniment to your order should you want more fries","Name: Saloniki Greek; Review: Just tried Saloniki for the first time and I am very happy that it's a part of the Fenway community!

Name: Skewers Wood Grill; Review: My experience was mediocre.  Skewer's appears to put their own spin on Greek food which was ok but I prefer traditional.  The gyro was not authentic, the meat had an odd consistency and it was not seasoned very well.  I also felt the sandwich was on the smaller side for the cost. The avgolemono soup on the other hand had an odd seasoning which took away from the usual lemon taste I enjoy.  The greek salad was the first I have had without olives and the lettuce was a bit wilted.  I was not provided plastic utensils for takeout which irked me because I planned on eating it takeout

Name: GRECO; Review: Food was okay. I got the chicken gyro but subbed honey mustard for tzatziki sauce. I found the meat a little bland and the fries desperately needed more salt. I would probably order the next one without any fries because they detracted from overall experience so much. Additionally, I didnt see prices their drinks I got a canned tea (company is greek so thats cool) and I'm pretty sure it was close to $5 that's ridiculous. The Loumounades!!!!!!! ORDER THEM!! They are made fresh and in house. I got the classic ones with honey, cinnamon and walnuts. This dessert is delightful. The balls are fried perfectly. They retain their crunchy exterior even after being covered in honey. The Loumounades themselves are not sweet which is lovely so you don't end up with sugar overload. Additionally, this greek honey is like no other honey I've had. It is delicious and not cloying in the slightest. Do yourself a favour and order them. This was the highlight of my meal. The service was top notch. They person taking my order was patient and friendly. They brought everything out and even brought me napkins. It was a friendly environment and the decor is super cute

Name: Zo Greek Cuisine; Review: I tested ZO State St this year in August. Gyros chicken and gyros original (pork). It's not bad, the produce is fresh but I'm sorry it's not Greek food. Visually it looks but tastefully it's bland, not bad but bland. And no one speaks Greek here.  I tasted ZO State St this year in august. Gyros chicken and original gyros (pork) It's not bad food the products are fresh but I'm sorry it's not greek cuisine. In your hand it looks like a kitchen in your mouth it's bland and tasteless. And nobody speaks greek here!  Δοκίμασα ΖΟ φέτος τον Αύγουστο. Γύρος κοτόπουλο και πρωτότυπο γύρο (χοιρινό) Δεν είναι κακό φαγητό, τα προϊόντα είναι φρέσκα, αλλά λυπάμαι που δεν είναι ελληνικό φαγητό Στα χέρια μου μοιάζει με ελληνικό φαγητό αλλά στο στόμα μου είναι άγευστο.

Name: Uptowne Mediterranean Restaurant; Review: I found out Uptowne Mediterranean Restaurant by accident. I was shopping in the plaza where it's located and it was lunch time so I wanted to give it a shot. They have great food for really great prices. The chicken and meat shawerma is as fresh as it can be. They cut it off the big rotating skewer and make your meal. The kebabs, appetizers, salads and fixing all are authentic Mediterranean recipes. Lots of Vegetarian choices as well. Falafel, Spinach pie etc. It's a family run business and everyone helping each other and the customers. I started also using them to cater for our company lunches. They make big platters also can make sandwiches. It's the best thing I discovered which reminds me of home. Thanks for your time reading this review

Name: Mykonos European; Review: The BEST gyros you will ever eat! My family ALWAYS eat here and most often only come to the mall for these gyros. The owner and her son are always friendly to every customer and the gyros are fresh and packed with delicious gyro meat. Always add feta to it.  Always"
Vietnamese pho delivery,"Name: Saigon Hut; Review: This is one of the best places to eat pho, period. Not in east Boston, not in Boston. One of the best. I’ve had pho from all across the US and nothing else compares, even in the heart of Vietnamese neighborhoods on the east coast. And it doesn’t just stop at pho - the menu is large and has quite a bit of variety, but everything I’ve had here so far was great. There’s even vegan options available, and according to my vegan friends, the veggie pho is worth raving about too.  I could talk about this place all night.The price is good, the quality is amazing. The owner is so sweet and nice, to the point you feel like family. There isn’t a reason to not eat here. If you like pho, you have to stop here
Name: Phở Lê Restaurant; Review: OK so I'm a mi dang and grew up around  the Vietnamese community, I ordered a bowl of Pho Ga Xe Lua at ""Pho Le"" yesterday. When I say the noodles weren't fresh at all! Listen, I love vietnamese food more then american cuisine and would rather eat different food from different ethnic backgrounds on a daily basis. But to give me old noodles that I had to break apart in luke warm water? As if the noodles take long to boil, and I'm not about this PHO LIFE is pure laziness... I'm use to tasting the love in the Viet food I eat, like somebody's grandma put their whole foot in it toe nail and all lol, it's just an expression...... But even a black man knows fresh rice noodles don't stick......😒😒😒 it's only right to say Anh Hong And Saigon Seafood are still the best places to go for Pho in Dorchester not even Pho Hoa has what it truly takes... If you want Ca Nuong go to Pho 2000, their pho is good too but Aslong as your precooking your noodles and refrigerating them you will fail........... Do better Pho Le...........  I still tipped yall too so y'all can't call me cheap...
Name: Pho Basil; Review: This was the second pho place I've visited in Boston (first being Pho Pasteur). I got the Dac Biet, which was very good. I wanted to get the best pho on the menu, and this was it. I asked the waiter about the sizes and she confirmed that they were all large (she, nor the menu, didnt indicate whether you could get a smaller or larger bowl and if that would affect the price). Though the pho was good, I would say that it was more expensive that pho Pasteur (the cheapest pho here was pho ga for 9.50). The service and ambiance here are definitely better here than at pho Pasteur, though I felt they skimped on the sprouts and Basil (see pic). For now, I will keep going to Pho Pasteur by myself because of its price, but pho Basil will be the place to take my guests (and maybe by myself one in a while). Lastly, please don't go by the prices on the google maps menu for this place
Name: Pho & I House Of Noodle And Rice; Review: Ordered the pho biet. In terms of the food, the broth was nearly tasteless. Compared to pho Basil, pho Pasteur, and the pho I ate while in Vietnam, this is bar far the least appetizing pho I have ever tasted. There is one size, so you can't order less or more. We also ordered carb Rangoon, which were the only good part of what we ate. With the pho, you only get one small plate of Basil, lime, etc. The waiter was also not pleasant at all. We felt rushed, and she seemed impatient, as if she didn't want us there. Never going back and would not recommend
Name: Pho Hoa Restaurant; Review: We used to go to Phoa Hoa all the time when they were in their old location next door. This place hasn't change since a few years ago i stopped going there since Pho Le opened up. Pho Le parking lot was full so we went to Pho Hoa. The service is horrible here still. We waited 15mins with a bunch of people in the front of the restaurant. No host was there to see who came in first or who was next in line. People were just screaming out Vietnamese and got seated so I had to scream to get my family a table. When we got seated the restaurant was basically half empty in the back. Waiter came and drop off water and gone. We waited 10mins and no one came to take our order. We had to wave down another waiter to get our order placed. We ordered summer rolls and our pho. The pho came out and our rolls were not. We had to ask for it. so half way done with our Pho the rolls came out. Waiters were running around like chicken with their heads cut off. It was not extremely busy but very disorganized. I will not be going back again","Name: Pho Viet’s; Review: I needed a grab and go lunch in Newton after dropping off a UPS package and decided to give Pho Viet's a try. After calling about 10 minutes away and placing my order, I was happy to see it ready to go when I arrived. For $18 after tax and tip, I got two banh mis (not just for myself! I ordered for my partner too) and an order of summer rolls. Everything was super fresh, the veggies (fresh and pickled) were nice and crisp, and both the pork and ham banh mi was excellent, with lots of lard paste and big cuts of meat. The bread was incredible! Crispy without being overly hard, it didn't feel like an obstacle to the meat and veggies of the banh mi but a true complement, which I find rare.  For a quick and very affordable lunch (that banh mi kept me full until way past dinnertime), Pho Viet's seems like a great place to go. I'll definitely be back to try their noodle soups next

Name: New Dong Khanh Restaurant; Review: This restaurant is small but more than makes up for it with the great delicious food they serve. I've only ordered the pho so far which include beef flank plus tripe and the spicy tomato beef brisket but boy do they nail it every time. I not only finish the food but the broth as well, it is tasty. If you are looking for drinks they have a smoothy bar which are blended with actual pieces of the cut fruit rather than all powdered flavoring. I highly recommend the avocado boba smoothy.  The staff is very attentive and they surprisingly have a waitstaff to bring you complimentary tea and serve the food. Overall you not only have great food but beverages as well. The prices here are fair and more than worth it especially with how generous they are. Also remember to bring CASH ONLY
Name: Saigon Fusion; Review: Had Pho and spring roles there. I just want to say there is a reason they have a 4.9 star rating here. Pho was amazing. Broth was well seasoned, meat was very tender, tasty and not beefy or gamey at all. Noodles were perfectly firm and not tough. Spring roles were fresh and the rice paper was soft and not chewy at all. Will recommend 100%
Name: Phở Lê Restaurant; Review: OK so I'm a mi dang and grew up around  the Vietnamese community, I ordered a bowl of Pho Ga Xe Lua at ""Pho Le"" yesterday. When I say the noodles weren't fresh at all! Listen, I love vietnamese food more then american cuisine and would rather eat different food from different ethnic backgrounds on a daily basis. But to give me old noodles that I had to break apart in luke warm water? As if the noodles take long to boil, and I'm not about this PHO LIFE is pure laziness... I'm use to tasting the love in the Viet food I eat, like somebody's grandma put their whole foot in it toe nail and all lol, it's just an expression...... But even a black man knows fresh rice noodles don't stick......😒😒😒 it's only right to say Anh Hong And Saigon Seafood are still the best places to go for Pho in Dorchester not even Pho Hoa has what it truly takes... If you want Ca Nuong go to Pho 2000, their pho is good too but Aslong as your precooking your noodles and refrigerating them you will fail........... Do better Pho Le...........  I still tipped yall too so y'all can't call me cheap...","Name: Pho Viet’s; Review: I needed a grab and go lunch in Newton after dropping off a UPS package and decided to give Pho Viet's a try. After calling about 10 minutes away and placing my order, I was happy to see it ready to go when I arrived. For $18 after tax and tip, I got two banh mis (not just for myself! I ordered for my partner too) and an order of summer rolls. Everything was super fresh, the veggies (fresh and pickled) were nice and crisp, and both the pork and ham banh mi was excellent, with lots of lard paste and big cuts of meat. The bread was incredible! Crispy without being overly hard, it didn't feel like an obstacle to the meat and veggies of the banh mi but a true complement, which I find rare.  For a quick and very affordable lunch (that banh mi kept me full until way past dinnertime), Pho Viet's seems like a great place to go. I'll definitely be back to try their noodle soups next

Name: Pho & I House Of Noodle And Rice; Review: Ordered the pho biet. In terms of the food, the broth was nearly tasteless. Compared to pho Basil, pho Pasteur, and the pho I ate while in Vietnam, this is bar far the least appetizing pho I have ever tasted. There is one size, so you can't order less or more. We also ordered carb Rangoon, which were the only good part of what we ate. With the pho, you only get one small plate of Basil, lime, etc. The waiter was also not pleasant at all. We felt rushed, and she seemed impatient, as if she didn't want us there. Never going back and would not recommend

Name: New Dong Khanh Restaurant; Review: This restaurant is small but more than makes up for it with the great delicious food they serve. I've only ordered the pho so far which include beef flank plus tripe and the spicy tomato beef brisket but boy do they nail it every time. I not only finish the food but the broth as well, it is tasty. If you are looking for drinks they have a smoothy bar which are blended with actual pieces of the cut fruit rather than all powdered flavoring. I highly recommend the avocado boba smoothy.  The staff is very attentive and they surprisingly have a waitstaff to bring you complimentary tea and serve the food. Overall you not only have great food but beverages as well. The prices here are fair and more than worth it especially with how generous they are. Also remember to bring CASH ONLY

The only thing  that is good here is Bo Ne (item from their secret menu) and everything else is mediocre.  I have tried their vermicelli, pho and rice plates. They put way too much oil in their vermicelli noodle and on their rice plates they put too much salt on their meat. The pho is very impressive and i rather go somewhere else

Name: Pho Basil; Review: I honestly think that this place is the best Thai Vietnamese Fusion restaurants that I've been to. A lot of times I don't like going to Fusion restaurants because I feel like they do one type of Cuisine well but the other not as well. I can honestly say that this restaurant has really good Vietnamese food and really good Thai food. When I went here I ordered Thai food which was really delicious and a Vietnamese side dish which is also very good. My friend ordered a Vietnamese pho noodle and it was amazing. I honestly didn't expect that they would do both Cuisines so well together. Also, I came here for lunch and the prices were really reasonable and I would say even on the cheap side. I even had enough food to take home so that I could eat the next day. The service was great and the staff was very attentive. The food came out looking great, tasting great and at a reasonable pace. Keep in mind that this place does get really busy though even on a weekday. I think that every time I've been here I've had to wait for a seat. Even when I walked by the restaurant always looks packed. I definitely recommend coming here to try some Thai or Vietnamese food or both

Name: New Saigon; Review: Solid Vietnamese food. It has that authentic hole-in-the-wall vibe that will be a plus for some and not for others. The pho, bun, and bahn mi are all good and very fresh tasting. Definitely worth checking out if you like pho. The portion sizes were also spot on (the extra large is huge, very tasty). The combo fried rice was a bit bland and seemed to use frozen vegetables, not very impressed with that one. I think the the lemongrass fried rice or pork chop rice are probably better rice options. Only been here a handful of times so far, but would recommend it as a solid Vietnamese option if you're in the area

Steakhouse takeout options,"Name: Skilletz; Review: Always good comfort food and they do takeout.my favorite is fish and chips
Name: Orfano; Review: Great new addition to the Fenway area! Definitely on the pricier side compared to most of the other places in the area but the food and drinks were well worth the prices. The atmosphere is upscale, reminiscent of a higher end steakhouse but with small irrevent touches here and there almost reminding people it's still okay to have fun and this place isn't somewhere you have to be wearing a dinner jacket to get seated.  We started with the summer pasta and the ceasar salad. Both of these were great I only wish the pasta was a larger portion. The summer pasta was definitely not large enough to order as a meal but it worked great for the shared first course we intended it for.  For mains I had the lamb chops and opted for the anchovy/caper butter and my dining partner had the pork chop. It seems like steakhouse cuts of meat is where this place really shines. Both of these were phenomenal and cooked perfectly. I can only assume the dry aged ribeye is even more impressive but that'll be for next time.  Overall it was a really good dining experience. There was a lot of new staff working which made for some confusion getting seated and little hiccups in service along the way but nothing so egregious as to ruin the meal certainly.  Oh, and when they ask if you want pepper on your food, say yes. You gotta see the pepper grinde
Name: Fogo de Chão Brazilian Steakhouse; Review: FOGO DE CHAO BRAZILIAN STEAKHOUSE                                                                                      Westin Copley Place Hotel in Boston, MA.  In early October 2018, my wife and I were guests at the Westin Copley Place Hotel in Boston, MA.  While the hotel lived up to its reputation as one of the best in the city, the true gem within its doors is FOGO DE CHAO BRAZILIAN STEAKHOUSE.  The food, staff, and service is the best we have received during our numerous travels.  The staff was obviously professionally trained to ensure its customers feel they are valued and important.  The menu choices were so diversified and the food was so delicious, we ate in the restaurant or had appetizers at the bar three (3) of our four (4) night’s stay at the hotel. However, great food, which FOGO DE CHAO definitely has and poor service will not make customers return.  FOGO DE CHAO has GREAT FOOD and GREAT SERVICE!!! Therefore, I want to make special mention of three employees we met and who should be recognized by the corporate offices that owns FOGO DE CHAO BRAZILIAN STEAKHOUSE.  First, the bartender, (Saylor) (sp.), who made the most flavorful drinks we’ve had in a long time.  He was accommodating, patient and knowledgeable ensuring we understood the options and making the perfect drink.  Next was our server, Kimberly Zambrando.  She is highly qualified, pays attention to detail and made us feel like we were the only customers in the restaurant.  She was so wonderful we turned to another table and asked how they felt about her service.  They were equally pleased with her ability to please her customers.  Lastly, and we think one of the most important links in the chain of quality was our manager, Maicon Delfino.  He introduced himself the first night we visited the restaurant.  I have met many managers during my visits to restaurants, but Mr. Delfino was one of the few that was warm, knew our name, and asked thoughtful questions stating we should ask for him if we needed anything or wanted to share our experience at the restaurant good or bad.   He greeted us by name each time we went back to the restaurant or bar during our stay. Again, we hope the corporate offices that owns FOGO DE CHAO makes note of this review.  Mr. Delfino (manager), Ms. Zambrando (server), Mr. Saylor (bartender) should be on their radar as the best of the staff at the FOGO DE CHAO BRAZILIAN STEAKHOUSE in the Westin Copley Place Hotel in Boston, MA
Name: Marlborough Super Buffet; Review: I must say that this is a fun place for a group of people. The food at this place is consistently pretty okay. The food is best around the noon lunch rush and the 6-7pm dinner rush as the options are refreshed regularly.  There are a ton of options to choose from. As with typical Americanized Asian food offerings, you'll find the standard options like spare ribs, chicken with broccoli, rice options, and chicken fingers plus wontons, soup, crawfish and more. Additionally, the dinner menu comes with an option for the hand made sushi that's pretty good!  They're are also options for the fussy eating underage crowd: chicken tenders, pizza, french fries and the like.  It's not fine dining, but it's a great place for a good meal
Name: Tipico Dominicano; Review: Great place if you love Dominican Food. Several options","Name: LongHorn Steakhouse; Review: 3 couples, one from out of state, early dinner. Called ahead and were seated within 10 minutes of arriving. Server pleasant but....  5 of our meals came way too fast, less then 2 minutes after our salads had been delivered. Pet peeve: the servers stood there, both hands full, expecting us to make room on the table. And, the 6th meal, also a ribeye steak, was mysteriously delayed another 10-15 minutes (or actually served at the correct interval.) On the plus side, everything was cooked as requested, although the larger ribeyes were not noticeably bigger than the regular ones. Everyone said the steaks were tasty but way too salty, as were my shrimp. A hostess came by to hear our complaints about meals being served too quickly and the missing steak, and made soothing noises, hinted at comping us dessert, but essentially did nothing. We've eaten here enough times to have expected better
Name: AK's Takeout & Delivery; Review: At approximately 11:30 pm I was feeling very hungry and ordered a steak and cheese  with onions @Aks. unbeknownst to me they charged me for a large 10+ when I never specified the size.considering I was hungry I didnt make a big deal. when  I got my steak and cheese the toasted bread was burnt,  still hungry, I took a bite into the sandwich and all I tasted was salt and bread crust. Now i am sitting here, wanting to puke, drinking a lot of water due to the excessive salt .  I do not expect a gourmet meal but a decent sub. After all it's just steak & cheese and they fail at that. I personally will not be going back. If anything I suggest buying a slice. (hopefully they can manage not burning that) oh wait, they did . Sunday, when I ordered 2 large pizzas for the Patriots game. I am done
Name: Vintage Restaurant and Lounge; Review: I had their steak that was sliced up and it was the most tasteless steak I have ever had.  For 26$ which was one of their most expensive meal items on their menu was a hudge disapointment. They must have just taken the steak out of the freezer and just slapped it on the grill and that's it. This was takeout and they knew we are from the hotel accross the street and yet no utensils or napkins or anything.  My wife's meal had things missing as well.  This is my second review in my life and the first review was a positive one.  Not recommended in my oppinio
Name: Morton's The Steakhouse; Review: The bar was a warm and scenic place to eat on a frigid afternoon, but be aware that the parking is limited to very few metered spots and a couple parking garages. Mortons does not validate parking in the afternoon. We paid $20 to park across the street. It made for an expensive lunch. For a burger, tacos, a diet coke, and 1 beer, the bill was a staggering $61.00. The center of the burger was rare even though I ordered medium-well. They then made a new burger, but by the time mine came, my husband had finished eating. No comped meal, no perks. The manager hand delivered my 2nd burger and stated he would check in with me once I had eaten. Surprise, surprise...he never followed through with his own statement.  It's a shame to spend so much money and be disappointed with the food. On top of that, the manager did not make any considerations to our tab. I'd suggest you consider other food options around the seaport before eating here
Name: Salvatore's; Review: I ordered the Steak Tips that came with fries and broccoli. I have never gone to a restaurant and been so disappointed. I have eaten steak at many restaurants and have experienced mediocre steak plenty of times, but this was absolutely disgusting. I asked for medium well and the meat was burnt on the outside yet raw on the inside. To make things worst, there was literally no seasoning on it, so it was just a tasteless, chewy mess -completely inedible. The broccoli and fries were also flavorless. I can see how someone can get steak tips wrong, but broccoli? How is a restaurant that charges over $25 per plate incapable of making decent broccoli? The fries were the only edible part of the meal. If I wanted just fries I could have gone to the Five Guys nearby and paid $6 instead of $28. It was a COMPLETE waste of money and left me frustrated for the rest of the day. I am still appalled that a place could charge nearly $30 per plate without being able to cook steak tips properly. There were less than 5 customers in the entire restaurant, so there was no rush or pressure to serve, so that's definitely not the reason why the food was inedible. Our server also noticed that I had not eaten the food at all, but did not check in about the food or ask if there was something wrong. I am thoroughly disappointed and will not be returning. Save your money","Name: Morton's The Steakhouse; Review: The bar was a warm and scenic place to eat on a frigid afternoon, but be aware that the parking is limited to very few metered spots and a couple parking garages.

Name: Great Barbecue; Review: Great takeout. $12 for half a chicken and $1 for rice. Delicious, simple, and fast. Excellent place to grab a quick bite and super friendly staff. Hidden gem in Chinatown

Name: The Chateau Restaurant Norwood; Review: Food ordering was fast, the girl taking my order seemed polite - no issues there. Due to covid19, currently all orders are automatically “made to go”. They’ll bring it right out to your car. Cool.  I hand her my credit card, she does her thing and has me sign the bottom of the slip. I leave a really-really generous tip (knowing restaurants and waitstaff are HURTING right now). I take my card, head out to my car and wait it out.  Soon a guy comes out with my order hands me the order I thank him and take off. I get back to my hotel room and find out that the utensils were missing. Not a big deal for many, but it is for me! I’m hungry smelling my food and the hotel has removed everything they usually have out due to covid19.  I’m letting this one slide because it’s partly my fault for not checking the bag before taking off. It just upsets me that something so easy and simple was not included with my order.  It wouldn’t be an issue at all, but they charged a material fee (probably for the paper bag).  Please.. include utensils for takeout. I also didn’t get butter for the bread. This shouldn’t be happening. 4 people standing around, someone’s dropping the ball

Name: Boston Chops South End; Review: I really picky with steakhouses, so for me to give this place five stars is saying something. This is definitely one of the top steakhouses in Boston, up there with grill 23.  Main Dish: As you might expect the quality of the meat is excellent. They cook the ribeye consistently every time. I usually get their signature ribeye.  Appetizers: I also highly recommend their bone marrow appetizer. I usually don't order seafood at a steakhouse, but their calamari is perfectly cooked and tender (most places are really dry it out).  Sides, Dinks, Etc. It's hard to go wrong with the sides. I personally recommend the spicy broccoli.... That spicy sauce they use can go with any vegetable And the Mexican street corn is delicious. Again it's hard to go wrong with most mixed drinks and it's personal preference. I like the new negroni made with rye whiskey.  The bread popover is a freebie... Hard not to eat the whole thing.  Unfortunately I never have room for dessert so I can't help you there but the options look good.  Highly recommend this place 👌

Name: Texas Roadhouse; Review: Consistently good. Good cuts of meat. Choose your own steak if you like when you walk in. They will ask if you'd like to choose from a display case that has a few nice selections in it. They give you generous portions for your sides. My faves are the sweet potato which is always thoroughly cooked but never mushy, and the cup of chili, which is soooo nice and spicy. Wines by the glass are reasonable, with a few selections to choose from, and the special drinks are fun options. They don't have much in the way of dark brews, but they do have several domestic and imported beers including on tap. For a nice steak dinner date in a casual setting, Texas Roadhouse is a good choice without breaking the bank. Kid friendly, always. BEWARE though if you have a peanut allergy - DO NOT GO. They hand a bucket of peanuts and an empty bucket out to each table to share. It is not at all frowned upon to keep it carefree with the shells so you'll find lots of peanut shells on the floor (it's part of the charm/relaxed atmosphere). Seriously... If you have a peanut allergy, stay away. Otherwise, good fun place with hearty eats","Name: Boston Chops South End; Review: I went to Boston Chops last night to celebrate my friend and I’s birthdays and we wanted to treat ourselves to a nice steak dinner. Another friend came along. The service was pretty good at the start, and the server was friendly, but right in the middle where we needed her attention the most she kind of disappeared. I figured she got busy so it wasn’t a big deal, but after reading about other people’s experience with service I was a bit surprised. My friend and I both got the filet and another friend got the tuna. I always get my steak medium well - when mine first came out, it was definitely medium rare so I sent it back and asked for it to be cooked more. They did, but it was still pretty undercooked and they also hadn’t let it rest at all so I lost most of the good flavor trying to cut into it.  I ate it anyway because I was paying $45 for it and I didn’t want to be “that person” to send a steak back twice, but for that price at a steakhouse I’d think they should know how to cook a steak to the requested temperature the first time. But, the sides were good even though I didn’t get to have my steak with any of the sauce because it was kind of mixed in the sides and I was hungry so I ate them while waiting for my steak to come back. I also think that for the price of the wine, they could have been a bit more generous with the pour.  Just a head’s up, they’re currently only serving bottled water and it’s $6 per bottle. I get that that they probably need to bring in extra costs however they can so that doesn’t bother me, but we weren’t expecting it so just wanted to let other future diners know

Name: Sixth Gear - Cask & Kitchen; Review: . We ordered the Black and Blue Burger cooked medium. I ordered the Broadway sirloin cooked well done.  The dinners were brought to us with the burger cooked well and the steak cooked medium. I could not eat the steak the way it was prepared so I sent it back to be cooked a bit longer. My husband was hungry so he ate the burger even though it was over cooked.  When the waitress eventually brought my food back out again, the steak was still medium well. By that time, my husband had already finished eating his over cooked burger and I knew I didn't have enough time to send the steak back to the kitchen again, so I asked for my dinner to go and told the waitress I would take it home and cook it myself.  There were only 2 other patrons in the restaurant. No reason for our order to not be right.

Ethiopian injera delivery,"Name: Lucy Ethiopian Cafe; Review: First time trying Ethiopian food and had an overall good experience at Lucy. Came for lunch at noon on a Sunday after a snow storm so we were one of two groups there.  Setting: nothing special. Tile floor in the bottom of a building on Mass Ave. You don't come to the Ethiopian restaurants for the ambiance.  Service: Very nice waitress who gave us an extra side dish...it pays to be nice to people!  Food: So for those who haven't had Ethiopian food before, it often comes on this thin bread called Injera (made from Teff flour). You use the bread, which is chewy, to scoop up all the yummy flavors in front of you. We ordered the combo for two which came with well-spiced beef chunks in the middle surrounded by lentils, potatoes, spinach, chickpea, and collard greens. The beef was my favorite part of the meal but I was slightly disappointed that the injera and some of the sides weren't warm...I expected everything to be at least warm, if not hot. The flavors were there across the board, just the temperature of the food could be improved (perhaps it was a fluke!).  Definitely not a place to take a first date...it's hard to have good manners eating Ethiopian food
Name: Addis Red Sea; Review: I love the entire experience of eating Ethiopian food. And Addis Red Sea is one of the best places for it.  We came early for dinner on a Friday evening and were promptly ushered to a table. We ordered the Tej (Ethiopian honey wine) and the Ethiopian tea. Both were excellent. The wine was sweet as expected. Ethiopian tea isn't served with milk but is spiced, and was quite tasty.  We ordered the doro alcha combination with three veggies and the yasa tibs (fried fish fillet). All of it served with injera, a spongy crepe. The experience of sharing your food is really great! The injera here is not too sour for which I'm thankful. The chicken in the doro alcha was tender and well cooked. All the veggie dishes were tasty too. The yasa tibs however was bland, no spices at all and didn't taste quite fresh.  Service was attentive and all our questions regarding the food were answered. The ambiance is pretty cozy too. A little dimly lit with beautiful Ethiopian artifacts and paintings adorning the walls.  There are so many different options to try on their menu, that we'll surely be back soon. Can't wait to try their sambusa
Name: Addis Red Sea; Review: The food was not hot when we got it. I was told that we would have to pay a surcharge for small plates and forks to eat a cake that we bought for my childs bday. We waited almost an hour to get the food. Today I went back to just order injera and they are charging $2 for each 1. He said because they are giving it away in the restaurant for free with the meals. They will not be getting anymore of my money. I now have to find a new restaurant.  Update: I have been back to the restaurant since because they do have the best injera. The last time we ate in we waited 30 minutes and then decided to walk out because no one addressed us. The manager caught me and apologized then offered a free appetizer which the kids loved (they got to try something new). Yesterday I sent my daughter in to get just injera and they would not allow her to get it and she has done it before. She signed my name which would have been fine because there is no signature on my card and the purchase was under $25 (no signature is required). I did send her in a second time with my ID. The owner came out and stated he knew I did the bad review, initially told him no because I did not remember, I have done a lot of reviews. I searched and found this. He was very nice and I told him that we drive all the way there because we love the injera and I don’t mind paying the $2. The shock was that I was told one price on the phone then went to pick it up and was given another. People raise prices all the time. He even offered other solutions when there is no parking
Name: Blue Nile Restaurant; Review: The injera was not fresh at all and that is the base of the meal. This is my first and LAST time here. The restaurants in the DMV are WAY better and I am still looking for a restaurant similar. There is also a weird rule that one ""entree"" per person but normally Ethiopian food is ordered to share. They also forgot my drink and did not serve anyone water until a white family came in. The tea normally called chai that we ordered was not Ethiopian tea (normally classified by certain spices) but rather Lipton tea and a stick of cinnamon. The apple and white grape cider was 3.50 and served in a wine glass when it was s glorified small serving of sparkling welches juice. We also requested a side of tomato salad which is a common side in Ethiopian foods and was ensured that all entrees come with a salad that is filled with tomatoes instead we were met with a disappointment to salads everywhere there was literally 2 slices of tomato. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else that has more reasonable prices because this is not representative of the wonderful culture that comes from Ethiopia
Name: Lucy Ethiopian Cafe; Review: Mostly a coffee house with some standard sandwich fare, Lucy also has several FANTASTIC ethiopian items on their very affordable, made to order menu. The chalkboard menu, full of fun factoids about Ethiopia, changes to offer regular customers a range of food over time. Potently flavorful, but not painfully spicy (though you can request a delicious homemade hot sauce if that's how you prefer it), most dishes come with spongy, slightly tangy injera bread to act as your primary eating utensil. They also have a room in the back where they offer elaborate Ethiopian coffee ceremonies. The owner and staff are so incredibly proud of what they do here, and they have every right to be.

I order the vegetarian platter for 2, which is what I order at about any Ethiopian restaurant, and added a beef dish as well. I wasn't fond of the ""white"" injera the brown teff is much more flavorful, and a couple of the dishes I chose for the platter  (similar or the same to ones I always choose) were pretty bland. Good, but bland.  Wait staff was pleasant, and compensated our beverage orders because they were out of an original choice of something we wanted to order.

Name: Addis Red Sea; Review: I love the entire experience of eating Ethiopian food. And Addis Red Sea is one of the best places for it.  We came early for dinner on a Friday evening and were promptly ushered to a table. We ordered the Tej (Ethiopian honey wine) and the Ethiopian tea. Both were excellent. The wine was sweet as expected. Ethiopian tea isn't served with milk but is spiced, and was quite tasty.  We ordered the doro alcha combination with three veggies and the yasa tibs (fried fish fillet). All of it served with injera, a spongy crepe. The experience of sharing your food is really great! The injera here is not too sour for which I'm thankful. The chicken in the doro alcha was tender and well cooked. All the veggie dishes were tasty too. The yasa tibs however was bland, no spices at all and didn't taste quite fresh.  Service was attentive and all our questions regarding the food were answered. The ambiance is pretty cozy too. A little dimly lit with beautiful Ethiopian artifacts and paintings adorning the walls.  There are so many different options to try on their menu, that we'll surely be back soon. Can't wait to try their sambusa
Name: Lucy Ethiopian Cafe; Review: First time trying Ethiopian food and had an overall good experience at Lucy. Came for lunch at noon on a Sunday after a snow storm so we were one of two groups there.  Setting: nothing special. Tile floor in the bottom of a building on Mass Ave. You don't come to the Ethiopian restaurants for the ambiance.  Service: Very nice waitress who gave us an extra side dish...it pays to be nice to people!  Food: So for those who haven't had Ethiopian food before, it often comes on this thin bread called Injera (made from Teff flour). You use the bread, which is chewy, to scoop up all the yummy flavors in front of you. We ordered the combo for two which came with well-spiced beef chunks in the middle surrounded by lentils, potatoes, spinach, chickpea, and collard greens. The beef was my favorite part of the meal but I was slightly disappointed that the injera and some of the sides weren't warm...I expected everything to be at least warm, if not hot. The flavors were there across the board, just the temperature of the food could be improved (perhaps it was a fluke!).  Definitely not a place to take a first date...it's hard to have good manners eating Ethiopian food

Name: Blue Nile Restaurant; Review: This past Sunday we went for lunch to an Ethiopian restaurant, ""Blue Nile"" in Jamaica Plain. The restaurant itself is quite small, located in a busy neighborhood. We ordered 4 different dishes along with their in-house honey wine. The wine was bit too sweet for us, but was okay. The food took almost 20 minutes to arrive at our table, but food was delicious! We ordered one lamb dish (Yebeg Tibs), two beef dishes (Lega Tibs & Tibs Fir Fir) and one vegetarian combo dish (with Misir Wet, Shiro Wet, Yatakilt Wet & Yekik Alicha). Food was served on the traditional Ethiopean bread Injera, which you will find similar in texture and taste to Indian Dosa. The lamb and beef dishes were quite spicy but were very tasty. The vegetarian combo meal was less spicy, but was great too!

Name: Blue Nile Restaurant; Review: The injera was not fresh at all and that is the base of the meal. This is my first and LAST time here. The restaurants in the DMV are WAY better and I am still looking for a restaurant similar. There is also a weird rule that one ""entree"" per person but normally Ethiopian food is ordered to share. They also forgot my drink and did not serve anyone water until a white family came in. The tea normally called chai that we ordered was not Ethiopian tea (normally classified by certain spices) but rather Lipton tea and a stick of cinnamon. The apple and white grape cider was 3.50 and served in a wine glass when it was s glorified small serving of sparkling welches juice. We also requested a side of tomato salad which is a common side in Ethiopian foods and was ensured that all entrees come with a salad that is filled with tomatoes instead we were met with a disappointment to salads everywhere there was literally 2 slices of tomato. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else that has more reasonable prices because this is not representative of the wonderful culture that comes from Ethiopia

Cajun po'boy spots nearby,"Name: Augusta Market; Review: Best Cajun chicken sub ever! They make their own chicken. The rolls are always soft and the sauce is the perfect balance of delicious spicy to the point where you will sweat a little but not so hot that you have to wash it down with milk to put out the fire in your mouth. If you've ever enjoyed wings of mass distruction from east coast grill you need to eat this Cajun chicken sub. I've been eating here for decades and they consistently nail it every time

Name: Primo Pizza Restaurant; Review: We tried this place twice. The first time was terrible so we went back again and we had the same experience. The salad was filled with old, brown lettuce, the pizza tasted like a frozen pizza, and the subs are, at best, mediocre. I would not recommend wasting time at Primo's especially when there are other phenomenal spots right nearby

I have gone back at least 8 times in the last year and it has been very consistent.  Good comfort authentic Chinese food - can't miss...","Name: French Quarter; Review: Went down to this new restaurant on Washington Street in downtown crossing and what a pleasant surprise.  The decor, lighting, food and service were all top notch.  The drink menu was right off a little bistro near Bourbon Street and the food was perfectly spiced and flavored (with a majority of the menu able to be served gluten free).  The staff was courteous, knowledgable and very friendly.  All in all a great night and cannot wait to go back and try some more things (oyster and liver apps and fried chicken dinner were amazing
Name: French Quarter; Review: I am a Boston Foodie!!! I travel all around Massachusetts looking for great food and BIPOC safe restaurants and this restaurant gets my approval. It is not Black owned but the staff are POC and the Chef is PHENOMENAL! If I remember correctly he is from Louisiana and you can taste it in the cooking. I am from Boston but my family and tribes are spread all over the South. My fav is NC and New Orleans, this food is the closest you will ever get to that NOLA TASTE in Boston
Name: French Quarter; Review: Finally! Boston finally has an authentic New Orleans style restaurant. Everything from the cocktails to the desserts feel like they were ubered up from NOLA right then and there.  We visited the restaurant last month for a celebratory dinner and pigged out on just about everything. The crab cakes, fried chicken, BLACKENED SALMON, beignets, and bourbon pecan pie were ALL out of this world.  Seriously, I can’t recommend this restaurant enough. I’ve been raving about it to everyone I know. In a post Covid world, I’m sure this place is going to be packed every weekend
Name: Cajun & Grill; Review: I stopped by this place to take some Mexican food to go for my trip back to NYC. I ordered a bowl which consisted of grilled chicken, rice, beans and everything else I could possibly fit into the bowl. The portion was generous as I was able to have 2 portions - 1 for dinner and the other for lunch the next day. Was very filling and satisfying. A bowl and a bottle of water came to about $11 with tax
Name: Cajun & Grill; Review: Pretty good mexican food that doesn't take a long time for it to come out especially when you're in a rush to catch your next train to Worcester. It may sound expensive, but a chicken quesadilla may be a good dinner as the portion is huge.

Name: Bootleg Special; Review: Bootleg Special is a restaurant located essentially on the border of Boston's South End & Bay Village. It's  Cajun-inspired menu is long on shellfish, accented with a variety of the too-popular ""Small Plates"". The food is very good; the seafood is fresh and well prepared with sauces that enhance, but don't overtake the main ingredient. The cucumber salad is refreshing, and the garlic noodles were a nice complement. This was my second visit to Bootleg and the things that bothered me the first time still bother me. The food is delivered when it's ready. So 3 people can be eating for 10 mins before the 4th entree arrives. It makes for an awkward lull at the table. The place is noisy. Concrete floors & cinder block walls, accented with an elaborate chandelier and several smaller ""chandeliers"". On the left wall as one enters is a matrix of metal pipe that (apparently) serves no purpose other than to render the four-top tables that are against the wall, even less accommodating than they are already. They're roomy for 2, skimpy for 4. Did I mention the noise? There is eclectic background music playing, which contributes to the noise as diners try to be heard over it. Please understand I've been in *much* noisier places, but I long for the days when one could talk with one's dinner companions without shouting and repeating. The prices are very reasonable. Four of us had an entree & cocktail each, shared 2 small plates, and split the Bananas Foster Beignets dessert paying $48 each with tax & gratuity. Well worth the price. Enjoy it

Name: Paris Seaport Bar + Creperie; Review: Hidden gem, and a total gem at that.  It's in an unassuming, fairly weird location under some stairs, but with an active city view out of the glass walls surrounding it. But you won’t need to look outside too long, since you’ve got top notch service inside.  After my second visit there last night, I think this is one of my absolutely favorite spots in Boston. The food is lovely, every bit as delicious as the Brookline location of this creperie, but the cocktails elevate this location over the Brookline one. Brother Cleve helps you feel genuinely welcome, has a deep knowledge of the drinks he crafts (including the ingredients of them), and just helps ensure your experience is wonderful.  I can't recommend this place enough. Easily in my Top Ten in Boston thanks to a tremendous combination of value, flavor, and service

Name: Bootleg Special; Review: A cajun restaurant that does brunch...sure, why not? What's cool about Bootleg Special is they have traditional brunch items as well as the typical brunch items with a cajun twist...and of course, SOUFFLE PANCAKES! There aren't too many places that serve them so our main objective in coming here was trying them. It's a pretty cool dish but something I probably wouldn't order again. They are sweeter than your usual pancakes but they're light and fluffy. Some of ours were undercooked - for the most part they look cute and well done on the exterior but one of ours split open before we even cut into it and you could see the underdone interior (see attached photo). I like that they provided syrup, butter, AND condensed milk though! I definitely recommend sharing if you decide to get the souffle pancakes because you'll eventually get tired of eating the same thing over and over again.  The Traditional Benedict was pretty basic but not bad. We also got the Bootleg Mussel Bowl which was an interesting thing to have on the brunch menu but ok! I'm all for it. It was super flavorful and extremely garlicky with a kick. It also came with a side of pretty solid fries. Unfortunately my breath was kickin' for the rest of the day from the ridiculous amount of garlic, haha. When you look at Bootleg Special from the outside, you don't really see much because it's right next to a CVS and it looks pretty plain Jane. The interior is gorgeous though. There's an old charm to it with some tasteful rustic-ness

Name: Loco Taqueria & Oyster Bar; Review: Came here again and had an equally good experience albeit the long wait.  Came at 7:30 on a Tuesday night and the place was packed. If you don't like waiting, definitely try to make a reservation. We waited about an hour for 2 and had some margaritas while we were waiting (The Little Devil, which is deliciously spicy with jalapeno-infused tequila).  Everything we ordered was delicious...the Guac is some of the best I've had and their pica de gallo is simple but so fresh-tasting.  We ordered 4 of the tacos to share and here is what I would recommend in order: 1. Carne Asada (I'm biased because this also came with guac on it) 2. Cajun Roasted Chicken (this came with some sweet pineapple salsa on there as well) 3. Braised Short Rib 4. Fried shrimp (I just wish the shrimp were bigger)  Tacos are probably on the more expensive side vs. what you can get elsewhere but it's a nicer place.  I will continue to come back to Loco","Name: Real Deal, LLC; Review: Covid helpful info: parallel street parking, no meters. Most times of the day you can find a spot near this location. Once you walk into the joint you will go to the cashier to get your food. They have 2-3 tables inside but not sure if you can dine in there. No tables to dine out, it is mostly a location people do take out or delivery from.  This location is a local favorite for me. I used to live near the Cleveland Circle location, hang out with friends near the JP one, and now I live by the West Roxbury location and I love them all equally. Their food is consistent and they are always quick. My favorite app that I get almost every time is their onion rings because they are really yummy but I am a big fan of sauces and their kickin bayou sauce is delicious! The sauce is like a sriracha, Mayo, and other yummy things (real deal sorry if I’m wrong with those ingredients!) Meals I typically get are the Joe Spa (chicken Caesar wrap), Reuben, grown up grilled cheese, any burger, and any pizza. Definitely would recommend going to any of their locations

Name: Holly Crab; Review: This is not even close to a Cajun crab place. First, the flavor of the food can be described in one word: spicy. If the owner of the restaurant equates spicy to Cajun, then you have not tried real Cajun. Don't advertise your place as Cajun if all you have is spicy food. Second, price. The market price of a pound of king crab leg is ridiculous. It's about $5 to $10 per pound more than other places I have been to, let alone the ones in New Orleans. I guess there is no competitors in this area so they can charge whatever they want. Third, the tools they provide with you to work on the crab legs, they suck. Not sure why they don't use the standard ones which have a little hook that you can pry open the legs easily. The only good part about this place is they give you a pair of gloves so you don't smell like a crab for a week. I would not recommend this place to anyone who loves Cajun food and think they are going to get good Cajun food here

Name: Bar Lyon; Review: Overall this restaurant had outstanding French comfort food.I had the burger which was probably one of the best burgers I've had in the last 5 years I normally don't get a burger for dinner but I figured I'd give it a shot and it was boy it was good! Prices were not really cheap it was a moderately priced restaurant. Definitely was hopping when we were there.we plan to go there again soon not sure exactly what I mean it's a fair distance from where we live but it's worth the drive. If you do like true French cuisine I would highly recommend the cassoulet. Overall there's nothing on the restaurant menu that I actually could not recommend. We're big when it comes to French food and I would say everything on there was a winner

Name: Holly Crab; Review: I came on a weekday for dinner and there were plenty of seating so my party of 7 was seated immediately. The service was pretty good and the food came out at a reasonable time so it didn't take too long to wait for the food.  The seafood that comes in bags are what they're known for so I got shrimp, snow crab legs, and clams. I tried the Holly sauce and the Sweet Holly sauce. The sweet Holly sauce was actually really good. They also give free baguette bread that you can use to dip in the sauce and it's perfect because it soaks up the juices from the sauce. It would be better if the baguettes were warmed up though. You can also get rice and have it over rice which is also good. The shrimp didn't come out of the shell smoothly, sadly, but everything else was good.  As for some additional foods: - Cheesy noodles were decent but not as good as I hoped. It was kind of greasy. - Their wings are super crispy and very juicy. But, they were small pieces of wings so not a lot of meat in it and didn't have a lot of sauce covering it. - The boneless breasts were pretty good too. Like the wings, it was really crispy and the pieces were pretty thin. - Cajun Fries were good. A bit spicy for those not tolerant to spice.  Overall, a great seafood boil spot that also serves nice Korean style fried chicken! It's definitely a good spot to come with friends to share food and socialize as you eat messily together. At the end of your meal, you might feel a bit greasy from all the sauce settling in but it's a good experience and tasty"
Brazilian rodizio delivery,"Name: Brazilian Steak Grill; Review: This Experience was Unique!  Please read and share in the joy. When we decide to visit a restaurant we take a chance hoping the experience will be positive. My Fiancee and I are very adventurous and in fact it was I who chose Brazilian Steak Grill this time.  I am a resident of Marlborough and one day coming back from Home Depot I saw this restaurant but never stopped in. I knew it was there but never stopped in. This time it was different altogether.  As a Baby, I was given up for adoption back in 1963. I never knew my biological parents and I never knew if I had brothers or sisters. It so happens that I did a DNA test and I started to reconnect with cousins BUT in the process I found my long lost sister.  My Sisters name is Almitra, her husband Brent bought her a wedding anniversary gift, a trip to meet the brother she never knew she had. So we got together, we met and I decided to bring us to Brazilian Steak Grill Restaurant.  We entered the restaurant and were received warmly by the owner himself. The wonderful thing was that he took the time to explain all of the ingredients in his buffet display. Americans don't know much about Brazilian Cuisine but he gave us a crash course. He explained the different types of grilled steak, pork, chicken, sausage and more.  The owner made us feel welcome, important, valued and appreciated. In fact he made us feel like family. I later explained how symbolic the visit was to me, my sister and my family for being there.  Long story short. This is a wonderful establishment to eat at. The staff is friendly, the food is fresh and well cooked and you can taste the Brazilian Love and Hospitality.  We are extremely grateful to him, his staff and the Love we felt going there.

It is family owned, the food is delicious with no preservatives, there are lots of varieties including vegetables/salads, some of which are very healthy, and the meat is very tender and juicy. The staff is very friendly, warm, and courteous, and the service is outstanding. When my husband and I came in, we were greeted by a very nice young lady, Carole, and Ed, the owner, also greeted us and brought us a complimentary and delicious dessert (Pudim/flan) when we were done eating. We actually found out from him that the food is home made and there are no preservatives added. When it comes to the price, it is very reasonable and affordable. I highly recommend Brazilian Steak Grill and I would give this place more than 5 stars if I could
Name: Pollos A La Brasa El Chalan; Review: Today August 27 at around 4:10 I asked for a delivery, it was my first time asking for a delivery in this restaurant and the truth was the experience was very bad, I do not recommend it to anyone, they told me that the Delibery would arrive in 40 minutes because the address was local, when an hour had passed I called and a very rude man answered me, and he told me that delivery was going to hit me, and I told him that in how much time more and he said ""I don't know in about 10 minutes maybe ""I hung up and half an hour later they call me that the delivery is out,"" WHAT DO THESE PEOPLE HAVE IN THEIR HEAD? 1:30 hours for a local delivery ?? Are you kidding me ?? I told the driver that I no longer wanted him because it was too long and he replied with an ""Okay"" What lousy and uneducated people, anyway ..... they didn't recommend that they order here.
Name: Pad Thai Cafe; Review: It's sad to say that this restaurant is getting worse and worse. I order food delivery from them every week and every time when the order is delayed, I have to be the one contact the delivery guy. I ordered food today and 2 hrs passed I still haven't heard from the delivery guy. I called the restaurant and no one trying to help they don't even have a contact number of the delivery man. I will not go back. Very disappointed. At the end I I got the food late but it's not my order. I randomly get something else but not Thai food. This is ridiculous. I lost my money and I didn't get anything
Name: Emilio's Pizza; Review: They deliver ! But wouldn't deliver the food to my door , the driver parked down the street and told me to walk but got an attitude bc I explained that I pay for delivery so no matter what he needed to bring me my delivery ! INSTEAD HE PULLED OFF WITH MY FOOD ! Worst delivery experience ever !! They have no shame in what they say or how they go about the situation","Name: Brazilian Steak Grill; Review: It is the best Brazilian restaurant I have ever gone to so far.

Name: Brazilian Steak Grill; Review: Wow! We arrived at 10:30 on a Saturday night hoping to grab some sort.of food before driving home. We were treated to an amazing experience - from the first friendly greeting, to the perfect advice to this exhausted family about what to order, to the gorgeous voice of the woman singing, to the food....oh the food - that was hot, fresh, and delicious despite the late hour, to the invitations to come back soon as we left, it was a surprise meal that we were grateful we didn't miss and we will be back
Name: Brazilian Steak Grill; Review: This Experience was Unique!  Please read and share in the joy. When we decide to visit a restaurant we take a chance hoping the experience will be positive. My Fiancee and I are very adventurous and in fact it was I who chose Brazilian Steak Grill this time.  I am a resident of Marlborough and one day coming back from Home Depot I saw this restaurant but never stopped in. I knew it was there but never stopped in. This time it was different altogether.  As a Baby, I was given up for adoption back in 1963. I never knew my biological parents and I never knew if I had brothers or sisters. It so happens that I did a DNA test and I started to reconnect with cousins BUT in the process I found my long lost sister.  My Sisters name is Almitra, her husband Brent bought her a wedding anniversary gift, a trip to meet the brother she never knew she had. So we got together, we met and I decided to bring us to Brazilian Steak Grill Restaurant.  We entered the restaurant and were received warmly by the owner himself. The wonderful thing was that he took the time to explain all of the ingredients in his buffet display. Americans don't know much about Brazilian Cuisine but he gave us a crash course. He explained the different types of grilled steak, pork, chicken, sausage and more.  The owner made us feel welcome, important, valued and appreciated. In fact he made us feel like family. I later explained how symbolic the visit was to me, my sister and my family for being there.  Long story short. This is a wonderful establishment to eat at. The staff is friendly, the food is fresh and well cooked and you can taste the Brazilian Love and Hospitality.  We are extremely grateful to him, his staff and the Love we felt going there.

Name: Brazilian Steak Grill; Review: We try to get to this Brazilian Steak Grill  every weekend its so good!!!   The salad and side bar with it's different dishes is a great meal in and of itself but of course you must taste the excellent grilled steak - cooked to perfection!  There is also Braised beef, Bacon wrapped chicken and sausages. And PLEASE don't forget the crispy pork, YUMMY!   You will need to take home an order of the most luscious Flan if you have no more room in your belly, which is normally the case for me
Name: Fogo de Chão Brazilian Steakhouse; Review: Dined at Fogo with a 7pm reservation for my birthday, and really regretted it. I did NOT feel safe, and will likely be sending in a complaint to the Boston Public Health Commission/Department of Public Health. I figured it would be busy and in demand for a Saturday evening, which is why I made reservations and would hope that this system would allow for limited capacities indoors. Upon arrival, there seemed to be absolutely no attempt to reduce capacity - the place was absolutely packed so it was extremely difficult to actually distance yourself from other diners. Tables were maybe only 4 feet apart. When diners got up to leave, they would hover right over you because of how cramped it was. While I understood the need for the buffet process where you stand in an outer circle around the buffet bar and the staff lead you around putting desired items on your plate, the actual lining up on the central room caused such congestion with no distancing. Everyone was literally on top of each other.  On to the food. In this COVID-era there is no table-side carving of meats, but rather they pre-cut in the kitchen and the gauchos come out with plates/cutting boards with the meats to place onto your plate. This was frustrating because literally 75% of the time they would only have well-done or medium (think no pink) pieces left. Even when I requested medium-rare, they would put those well-done pieces on my plate. Pieces that were incredibly overcooked and dry. There were only a select few gauchos who cared to give me what I wanted and would come straight to me once they got a new batch to guarantee I could get that medium-rare.  I will say that I appreciated the complimentary birthday dessert, that our actual waiters were hard-working and constantly moving to serve our needs, and that they've implemented a table-side method of payment (picture a large palm pilot that you can scan/insert your card, tip, sign, and get your receipt from).  Overall this dinner was disappointing, and I was left feeling really uncomfortable. This Fogo has really let itself go - will likely not ever come back, especially with other upscale Brazilian BBQ restaurants popping up throughout the city","Name: Brazilian Steak Grill; Review: It is the best Brazilian restaurant I have ever gone to so far.

Name: Labaredas Brazilian BBQ & Bar; Review: Heard about the new ownership and wanted to give the place some support. Very glad I did.  I went on a Wednesday with my fiance and a couple friends from the area. They had a special for $9 burgers, which three of us got, and I was shocked at the size of it (huge). It was fantastic and a lot different than a burger you'd get at your typical dine in restaurant. Could not recommend enough.  My fiance was the outlier and got the Brazilian steak, of which I had some. Immediately wished I had gotten that. Not to say the burger was not amazing (it was), but the taste on the steak had me wanting more. Definitely going to get that the next time I come.  We had brigadeiro for dessert, which the new owner brought over and said was created with his mother's secret recipe. Admittedly, I have never had brigadeiro before but I would absolutely have it again.  Service was great and the beer tap was excellent. They even had Maine Lunch on tap for any beer aficionados.  Highly recommend giving it a try","Name: Brazilian Steak Grill; Review: It is the best Brazilian restaurant I have ever gone to so far.

Name: Churrascaria Vulcão; Review: For a great family experience and wonderful food check out restaurant  Churascaria Vulção located at 203 Adams Street Dorchester, Mass. 02122.  We had a great time and the food was very delicious and great service . I would  highly recommend them. ***** Great che

Name: Labaredas Brazilian BBQ & Bar; Review: I don’t know how I haven’t posted a review yet! I’m from Worcester & I’ve been waiting for a place that serves good Brazilian food & cocktails to open up like this one!  I’ve been coming here once a week on the weekends & each time bringing different people with us to show them this amazing place😄  The food here is delicious & the cocktails are so well made. (Get the Açaí You Next Tuesday or the Pisco Disco - SO GOOD!) Portions are generous. Everyone here is so friendly. My husband & I are definitely going to become regulars here"
Caribbean roti places nearby,"Name: Ali's Roti Restaurant; Review: Oh my god! So good.  It's always the same order. A small roti with chicken curry. You get two sides with a small roti - I go for the spiced potatoes and the mango curry.  The chicken curry is flavored really well, even a small bite is like an explosion of flavors in your mouth. The chicken is seasoned well and tender. As for the sides, the mango curry is a wonderful balance of sweet and spice (and everything nice). The mango itself is cooked well and has a hint of sour to it - goes superbly well with the chicken. The potatoes help balance all the curries. There is a little bit of heat in the curries, some days more than others! I'm not sure what the roti is made of (it's not like the tandoori roti you get at Indian restaurants) but, oh my, it goes well with the curry and the sides. Also, one time, they were out of the roti (we got there 15 mins before closing time). So the staff substituted rice for the roti, which was delicious too!.  Don't let the outside fool you. It may not look like much but give the food a try and you'll want it every day. The staff isn't very talkative but they are very nice and accommodating. This is definitely a favorite
Name: JP Roti Shop; Review: The roti didn't taste to good to me, nor did the doubles unfortunately. The sweet bread was great. The grocery part of the restaurant had some options that made me smile. I purchased about 40 dollars worth of groceries, seasonings and stuff.  The flow of the restaurant could be better. You walk in and unless you already know, you would walk into the restaurant part of the place, but you actually have to go to the grocery side of the restaurant, place your order, they write what you want on a bag. You don't pay there, you pay on the restaurant side.  You take your bag with the order written to the restaurant part, hand them the bag, then wait while others come in and out. Its kind of confusing. You can't really hear when your name is called, a few people got the wrong order. I actually watched a woman get the wrong order twice.  I was waiting 45mins, I went back up and had to ask for my order. I was then told part of it was not ready still. I guess a positive are cashiers. They're friendly, and conversational. They definitely need a better layout. Who ordered ahead needs a separate line, who's waiting another.  Roti 4 out of 10 bland Doubles 0 out of 10 I didn't even finish it. Price could also be better. I usually travel to Brooklyn NY for good trini roti, I will have to continue. I don't mind paying more if it tasted good, but I was disappointed.  They have great drinks that remind you of Trinidad, but it was like 1 or 2 of each, so there's that. Very limited.  ***update*** so after days of letting my last roti and doubles sit in my fridge I've had a change of heart. The doubles actually is good. I actually opened the doubles and noticed what happened. 5hey put some nasty green stuff in it that I was able to remove, and it was good after. The roti was still a little bland, but did taste a little better. Doubles gets a 7 out of 10 because no tambrind was available. Roti.. 5 out of 10 still
Name: JP Roti Shop; Review: The roti is great, but the service is terrible! I called ahead to place an order and they hung up on me! So I called again... and I was hung up on again! I called FIVE times before I decided to walk in and order. So I punch out for my lunch break and walk to the shop only to find a long line. And I don't mind waiting a little but twenty minutes is wayyy too long to wait in line to order! So, I'm waiting in line and the person at the counter was picking up all of the phone calls and ignoring the people in line! Like, where was she when I was calling earlier?! I ended up spending my whole thirty minute lunch break and then some waiting for my roti. I usually call ahead and buy food from Jp's on a biweekly basis and send somebody to pick it up for me, and they always have to wait for my order to be made even thirty minutes after ordering! I never really thought much of it because I got my roti when I needed it, but now, experiencing it for myself, I'm not going through this again and I will take my business elsewhere
Name: Caribe Restaurant; Review: It's similar to home cooked Caribbean food, the chicken thighs are my favorite, and the yellow rice with gravy is amazin
Name: Vaanga Boston; Review: First of all quality of service. Not at all appreciable. The guy at the counter doesn’t care if a new customer has just arrived and might need some assistance. Atleast welcome him. Nothing. He is just busy on his phone. I think he is a university student and is just working there part time. But it is owner’s responsibility to teach him hospitality.  Cleanliness is a problem with almost all Indian restaurant so is with this restaurant. Every table was dirty and mismanaged. When we asked him to clean he just wiped everything to the floor. Pathetic.  Third and most important quality of food. Chicken and chana masala has no taste. And roti was just like a papad.  Only good thing was that this guy agreed to change naan with a roti. That’s all","Name: JP Roti Shop; Review: Oh man I'm so glad I heard about this place. I got the beef roti with everything in it. It was spectacular.  The wrap skin was really tender and soft, the fillings were all really well seasoned and each was individually delicious so even though it is actually impossible to get a bite of everything at once (because it is huge!), every bite is still delicious.  I had called ahead and when I got there it was still a wait of maybe 20 minutes or so, which I had expected from the reviews. There was a crowd of 10 out so people waiting for their orders at 3 on a Saturday. There is no space to eat inside so you can only get your order to go
Name: Ali's Roti Restaurant; Review: There is not much to say other than this place has THE BEST ROTI'S IN BOSTON.  Others may be very good. Delicious even. But nothing can touch Ali's. The wrap is amazing and flavorful, the fillings are delicious. The curry is perfect.  I get the shrimp with cabbage and chickpeas (I'm a pescatarian) and it's awesome. My wife gets the goat. The portions are large and you will definitely be full by the end.  OK, the restaurant itself is not pretty. They aren't in a fancy area. There really isn't anywhere else you would want to go nearby. There isn't much parking.  Do not let that stop you from tasting their amazing food or you will be missing out on something truly great.  To be honest, I don't even remember what they charge. I doubt it's too much. It's not like I'm wealthy and don't look at prices. I just feel that whatever they do charge, is worth it.  Make sure to call and check the hours. They seem to be a bit different these (covid) days.  You owe it to yourself to try this place.  Awesome. Just awesome

Name: Ali's Roti Restaurant; Review: I won't be back! Parking is a nightmare but I had My Mom with me so she could move the car if need be. I have visited this location before without any issues. Tonight was awful the food had been sitting longer than it should've. You could tell by the thick layer of crust slowly moving towards the middle of the pan. They could've at least rotated the food so it wouldn't have been so obvious. The staff seemed tired. No greeting? Lastly I have never had an issue with portion size but tonight was a whole different story! The roti tonight was child size.

Name: JP Roti Shop; Review: I decided to try jp roti because ali's roti was closed... bad decision, waited in line for a long time b4 j realized some1 took ur order n wrote it on a paper bag, so dont even know how many ppl got ahead of me because i didnt know this. After waiting an extremely long time for my food, got home to a boneless roti that was sooo dry, 6 pieces of dry hard chicken n very little to no potato in my roti. The actual roti skin was much thicker that i m used to and the flavor was just not there BLAND. Not worth it or my hard earned $.. i hope Ali's isnt permanently close","Name: Boston Pita Cafe; Review: Oh My Gawd! The best stuffed grape leaves I've EVER had. Not my favorite, never really liked them. But these.... I could eat all alone for dinner. And the fresh meat on the rotisseries. Yummy. I'm coming back to this mall just for this restaurant. Three homemade taziki sauce is great too

Name: Tawakal Halal Cafe; Review: I live down the street from this restaurant, which is deep in the heart of Jeffries Point, Eastie (you can see the airport runways through the windows outside). Sitting down for dinner feels like you're in the kitchen of someones home. Its a bit small and cramped, but its a genuine neighborhood spot.  I tried the vegetable sambusa's, chicken chapati, and chicken biryani. It was all extremely fresh, delicious, comforting, and affordable. You can see them making the fresh chapati/roti (a type of flat bread akin to naan) right in the kitchen, and it was the highlight for me. The entire staff was welcoming and accommodating, and the owner/chef came to greet us with a big smile. He seems genuinely elated to be opening this restaurant.  I will absolutely come back for more

Name: Blue Mountain; Review: I stopped by today and was greeted with friendly customer service. I had read the article of Boston's top Caribbean and ethnic food restaurants and this place came up, and let me tell you.....IT DID NOT disappoint! The food was excellent. (A little more high end then I'm used to) but none the less I enjoyed my items. The food was flavorful and far from flat. The only thing was some of the food items such as the curry chicken and jerk chicken I had a difficult time identifying some of the flavors such as pemento. However the spice was there.(and it was fantastic) To me this resurant lives up to its Blue Mountain name and I'd highly recommend. Thanks Blue Mountain for serving me fine Jamaican cusine!!!!

Name: Raphael's Restaurant; Review: OMG!!! The food here is amazingly good.  It's a 10 out of 10.  I have never been disappointed with anything that I've ordered and I've eaten here at least 15 times.  Everything is authentically and deliciously seasoned and extremely flavorful. The deco & service is on the mediocre side but who cares when the food is so exceptional ( especially, in comparison to all the other ""Jamaican/Caribbean"" food spots in a ten mile a radius of this place)!"
Tapas delivery options,"Name: Porto; Review: While many restaurants are small in this area, and impossible to get a table, Porto is crowded and busy, but there were tables/bar options when I went and the staff worked to accomodate my group. The tapas style is more unique than traditional courses, but it did encourage sharing and they have options that include meat, vegetables, and fresh seafood, to please your entire group.  The flavors are recognizable but with little well-curated notes of citrus, nuts, or hot pepper. I was a big fan of their lobster wrap and their scallop ceviche; my fiance does not eat scallops and yet loved this. Service was quick, even for the entire branzino that was ordered. The only issue I had is that my octopus was chewy. Across over 10 different tapas/entrees, everything else was superb along with the service and my cocktail. Do note, this restaurant is on the pricier side as my friend exclaimed later, ""$9 for a lampchop?!?!?,"" but I found it worth the price
Name: Bin 26 Enoteca; Review: We went here on a recommendation. We thought by looking at the menu outside, the prices were reasonable. Once seated, the waiter informed us the menu is tapas style. Unless we missed this, there was no mention outside of this restaurant serving tapas style.  The food itself was average. The garden salad was just a mix of greens and my ricotta gnocchi in cream sauce was fair. Bread and oil are served with your meal.  On a positive note, the staff (host and servers) were very welcoming and friendly. The wine we had was great and the selection of wines were plentiful
Name: Pollos A La Brasa El Chalan; Review: Today August 27 at around 4:10 I asked for a delivery, it was my first time asking for a delivery in this restaurant and the truth was the experience was very bad, I do not recommend it to anyone, they told me that the Delibery would arrive in 40 minutes because the address was local, when an hour had passed I called and a very rude man answered me, and he told me that delivery was going to hit me, and I told him that in how much time more and he said ""I don't know in about 10 minutes maybe ""I hung up and half an hour later they call me that the delivery is out,"" WHAT DO THESE PEOPLE HAVE IN THEIR HEAD? 1:30 hours for a local delivery ?? Are you kidding me ?? I told the driver that I no longer wanted him because it was too long and he replied with an ""Okay"" What lousy and uneducated people, anyway ..... they didn't recommend that they order here.
Name: Pad Thai Cafe; Review: It's sad to say that this restaurant is getting worse and worse. I order food delivery from them every week and every time when the order is delayed, I have to be the one contact the delivery guy. I ordered food today and 2 hrs passed I still haven't heard from the delivery guy. I called the restaurant and no one trying to help they don't even have a contact number of the delivery man. I will not go back. Very disappointed. At the end I I got the food late but it's not my order. I randomly get something else but not Thai food. This is ridiculous. I lost my money and I didn't get anything
Name: Emilio's Pizza; Review: They deliver ! But wouldn't deliver the food to my door , the driver parked down the street and told me to walk but got an attitude bc I explained that I pay for delivery so no matter what he needed to bring me my delivery ! INSTEAD HE PULLED OFF WITH MY FOOD ! Worst delivery experience ever !! They have no shame in what they say or how they go about the situation","Name: Estragon Tapas; Review: Smell is principal to taste. When the smoked paprika - sweet, caressing, warmth - hits your nose it's a done deal: one relaxes into the feast of small plates delivering the biggest of flavors. The shishito peppers are just better here because (freshness?), (the evoo?), (the smoky element?), (the flaked flor de sal?). I'm a fan of morcilla as Boston's Puerto Rican community introduced me to it. Here at Estragón, they do it quite to my liking: some heat and crispy where it should be.  I prefer croquetas de bacalao to be more clearly, declaratively fishy-salt-cod than the creamy offering here. On the positive side, their crunch was perfect as was the crispness of the patátas bravas.  When chef/owner, Julio de Haro, carves Jamón Ibérico de Bellota from the ham holder and regales in his childhood stories of food, love, and technique, that meat-butter, served at the perfect temperature, melts in your mouth better, tastes better, is a more complete sensual experience.  I like tapas here more than anywhere else. I'm glad it's not a ""scene""... yet..
Name: Barcelona Wine Bar; Review: Having been to Spain a couple times and dined at a number of tapas and paella restaurants there, I can say that Barcelona Wine Bar is pretty authentic. My boyfriend and I came at 9pm on Sunday, and true to the Spanish custom of dining late, dinner was still bustling. Unfortunately, some dishes, like the octopus, were sold out, but mostly we were able to get what we wanted.  Charcuterie platter: We got a soft goat cheese, salami, and jamón serrano. All were delightful. The meats has just the right amount of fat and weren't overwhelmingly salty, and the cheese had a nice touch of tangyness and goatyness.  Paella de mariscos: We shared a paella for one between the two of us, and it was more than enough. The rice was a little hard and crunchy with ample wetness, which I liked. There were lots of onions and peppers in the dish though, which may or may not be to your liking.  Crispy beef tendon: Interesting but wouldn't order again. Wasn't that flavorful.  Duck confit salad: I just wanted some greens to balance the meal out, and this salad did the trick.  Albondigas (meatballs): Amazing! Juicy and full of tomato flavor. Loved the chunky ham and tomato sauce. Couldn't tell whether the stringy bits inside the meatballs were cheese, and as a lactose intolerant person, I'd rather not know.  Wine: I really enjoyed my Zarel-lo white wine.  Bread: Amazing. Probably one of the best parts of the meal. Warm, crunchy crust, soft and moist interior. Would buy this bread if they sold it.  The service was a bit flustered. Wasn't a huge fan of the waiter mansplaining tapas to me, and the server who poured our wine didn't give us a taste before pouring the glass. We also had to ask several times for oil for the bread
Name: Tapeo; Review: This place is fine... Nothing spectacular or memorable. The spinach dish was fresh spinach which was nice and the cheese with honey was good. The sangria was sweet (and they couldn't transfer or bar bill to our dinner table which was odd since they told us to wait at the bar).  The ambience was odd-super bright overhead lighting until we asked them to turn it down. The waiter was fine. The hostesses looked confused when we asked for a table and took a few minutes to get their bearings. The bartender was actually the friendliest of the staff.  With so many tapas joints in town, I'd recommend Barcelona for a similar price point--though you need a resi there and Tapeo took us as walk ins
Name: Scorpion Bar Boston; Review: Ordered curbside pickup on December 4. Due to the existence of a gift card our order had to be called in by phone, the old fashioned way. (There is no option to pay with a gift card on the online ordering portal.)  The food and drink were tasty. Classic margaritas were sealed in plastic, pint-sized to go bags; when opened they tasted excellent. (Dont forget to shake the bag well before opening and pouring!)  Chips and guacamole were perfect starters. Creamy style guac with some chunks. Lime forward taste, with a mild cilantro presence. Not too salty. Everyone liked the guac.  The Taco Kit (6 Tacos total: 2ea beef, chicken, carne asada steak, with shaved lettuce, diced tomatoes, SB Blend cheese, Pico de Gallo, guacamole sour cream, and corn tortillas) fed three adults, and was tasty. Although no one particularly loved the corn tortillas.  Easy curbside pickup,  with parking spots out front dedicated to the takeaway business
Name: Estragon Tapas; Review: The welcome was exceptional... seated in the lounge area in back... seated on the comfy sofa to eat tapas was the best! We had... (1) fried chick peas (delicious! ...but I think they are a wee bit overpriced for the size bowl you get), (2) shishito peppers (well cooked, but not well seasoned... some got hit with salt, some not), (3) tomato/garlic toast (really shouldn't buy tomatoes out of season, and they were under-seasoned... the toast was really good - in spots - some parts of the bread were yummy, other parts kind of plain), (4) garlic shrimp (cooked perfectly, great garlic sauce with a little heat in it), (5) vegetables with romesco (hit and miss again on the seasoning of the veggies, and the eggplant was kind of rubbery/chewy... the romesco sauce was delicious), (6) patatas bravas (I liked them, my wife thought the sauce tasted too much like spicy catsup), and chicken empanadillos (with the shrimp, one of the two best dishes if the meal). Given the notes... nothing was bad, but the seasoning of the food was uneven. For example, in the veggie/romesco dish, one slice of squash was fantastic, the next one, so-so. We will go back and try some other dishes, and either avoid the ones we were conflicted about or - in the case of the veggie dish - ask for it to be made to order (without eggplant). Mostly, I just would like too see better attention to making sure that all of the food is seasoned evenly. One more thing... the guy working the front of house (damn, forgot his name)... really excellent work, and I'll never want to sit anywhere but on the sofa in back ever again (thank you for that!!!)","Name: Estragon Tapas; Review: Smell is principal to taste.

Name: Tapeo; Review: I love this place - eat at the bar for cheaper prices!  I went here 10 years ago and fell in love with the place. I take my friends there whenever we travel to Boston and they love it as well. Although its not that same as 10 years ago I still love it.  We usually eat at the bar and get several of the $5 and $7 tapas plates and a pitcher of Sangria (usually more than one). Beware the sangria is strong (which is why I like it). The staff is always nice and actually speak spanish. Note that there are only about 12 or so seats at the bar so you may need to eat at the tables and pay full-price","Name: PURO ceviche bar; Review: Best meal of 2019 and it’s December!!  😋⚡️  Not even exaggerating, EVERYTHING about this place is wonderful. Every single tapa was delicious and not teeny tiny like another tapas place that starts with a B 😳Drinks were superb and crafted. Service was chill and speedy.  I’m hesitant to write this review because I want to be a secret Boston gem 😏  We ate: • the ceviche with passion fruit (the flavor depth is insane) • patatas bravas (amazing sauce) • elote (nommmm) • drinks on drinks  Keep doing what y’all are doing

Name: Blaze Pizza; Review: The Customer service here is awesome. They were very polite, food came out within decent time regarding the amount of customers, and this location was very clean. I know there are other Blaze Pizza’s in the area, but this one is the only one I have visited and I do recommend it for a relaxing lunch or dinner. Upon entering the restaurant it smelt so good with all the pizza that had already been made. When I went, it was pretty packed and it was a Monday! Because of the location, there is little to no parking, and whatever parking there is, it must be paid for, as most locations are in Boston. There are enough seats for a large party (10-20) to come in. It felt very family friendly, and cozy. I enjoyed how they have several different options of toppings, sauces, and crust; making the possibilities of different styles nearly endless! They do have a gluten free crust for those who may need it. Blaze pizza has quite a bit of vegetarian options options as well. That is a big plus in my books! The pizza that I ordered (Margarita pizza baby) was very delicious. The crust was crispy and cooked to perfection. I had ordered a large, but it appeared smaller then what I was expecting, that or I was lumping hungry! They use eco-friendly material and also have vegan options! This location does accept cash, card, and I think mobile pay but don’t take my word on the last one

Name: Tapeo; Review: Tapeo never changes. Tapeo, never change. This high volume tapas bar has every item on the menu that they had 15 years ago. None of them have changed, and that's just fine, because they're all perfect little versions of classic Spanish tapas dishes. Yes, there is a frequently changing list of tapas specials, and they are often very good, but it is so difficult to pull myself away from ordering my old standbys -- shrimp in garlic, scallops in garlic cream sauce, pork loin with goat cheese, tortilla espanola (the cold potato and egg staple dish of Spain), and chicken croquettes almost inevitably find their way to my table over the course of an evening there. On most nights, for many hours, tapas are half off at the bar, and the sangria -- which flows from a tap -- is one of the best examples of this often cloying concoction. Copper accents ensure Tapeo is never quiet, even when (rarely) empty, but the environment feels intimate nonetheless"
Turkish baklava places nearby,"Name: Turkish Lazuri Café; Review: This gem just opened up in my neighborhood.  The service is amazing, the staff are friendly and welcoming.  The menu (most, maybe all, Halal) has a variety of Turkish, American, and Italian dishes.  They offer a full breakfast menu, appetizers, entrees, sides, and an enticing array of homemade desserts, including THREE different types of, “made fresh, this morning, by Mom”, baklava.  Beverages include Turkish Tea and Turkish coffee.  This place is such a delight.  It has definitely earned a place in our dine in and take-out rotation
Name: Ali Baba Restaurant Boston; Review: Good authentic Turkish spot.  They speak English, but Turkish is their first language, and the food reflects it... delicious!  I had the Turlu (vegetable stew) $9, comes with Bulghur (rice), Ayran (yoghurt drink) $3 and bread (complimentary). All delicious.  Followed up with Turkish Tea ($2), and that was good as well. Total bill was 14.98 before tip, brought it to $15 with the tip (jk, I tip).  Bathroom is clean, nice floor, and some art work, but you have to go through the kitchen to get there.  They offer nice desserts (see photos) like baklava, and they make Turkish coffee. The have Splenda for your sugar substitute.  I would probably be a regular if I lived or worked near here.  Thumbs up if you appreciate this review
Name: Café de Boston; Review: It is a very big restaurant with many varieties. You can make your own pasta. You can make your plate from the cold bar (it is 30% off after 2:30). I returned and bought Turkish coffee. Doner kebab was good. Turkish coffee is already the same as in Turkey. A spacious place. It is very easy in transportation. I met an authorized Turkish sister there, but unfortunately I forgot her name now. The room restaurant introduced me and gave information. He said that they keep the website updated in terms of menu every day. They were not open on weekends because their workplaces were closed.
Name: Maria's Kitchen; Review: The interior of this place is beautiful and impeccably clean. We had the fish and chips and baklava. The fish was fresh and flaky with a really nice batter that wasn't too heavy and seasoned well. The baklava was also very nice. We will definitely be back to try more. Nice addition to Centre St. in West Roxbury
Name: Garlic 'n Lemons; Review: As others have mentioned, Garlic ‘n Lemons is very clean and the service is very friendly and polite. I ordered a mixed shawarma plate (spicy chicken and spicy beef) with tabouleh, rice pilaf, and garlic sauce, adding a falafel. I also asked for some spicy sauce on top. For dessert, I ordered a piece of baklava.  I haven’t seen shawarma sliced so thinly before, which isn’t a bad thing. I found that being so thinly sliced and dressed with sauce, I never had a dry bite, nor one that felt too saucy. The flavors were perhaps less intense than other excellent shawarma plates that I’ve eaten, but were as balanced and if anything, more nuanced. Though I am always a bit self conscious after eating a lot of parsley and garlic sauce, I wasn’t swimming in my own garlic breath after eating it. Anyway, it was really, really good. The falafel was good, though something of an afterthought. It is probably excellent when fresh.  The baklava, though tasty, had the syrup poured on it before being placed in the package, meaning that it was not as crisp nor as bright as other baklava that I’ve had, but still really tasty.  I found the price to be on par with other Middle Eastern counter-serve restaurants in the area, meaning that while reasonable, I wouldn’t call it cheap. All told, I paid $17-$18 for my meal, which seems fair to me, though I would have felt like I got better value if the baklava and the falafel were fresher. Overall, I certainly recommend this place","Name: Ali Baba Restaurant Boston; Review: Good authentic Turkish spot.

Name: Gyro and Kebab House; Review: The first time we went specifically to Turkish cuisine. And I liked everything. Food, service, hall. There were few people and the distance was kept. Hot bread with different sauces, lamb kebab with fresh salad, meze. Strong tea is free. The second time there was another shift and everything somehow got worse. There were no more sauces for bread, everything somehow decreased in size. The third time again there was not a lot of things, plus they ordered a lahmajun with them, and unlike the previous time, it also became smaller, they did not put sauces on it and did not cover it with paper.

They offer nice desserts (see photos) like baklava, and they make Turkish coffee. The have Splenda for your sugar substitute.  I would probably be a regular if I lived or worked near here.  Thumbs up if you appreciate this review"
Ramen bowl delivery,"Name: Santouka Back Bay; Review: This is a solid Ramen spot that will not disappoint. I stood in line with many others for ~40 min on a cold winter day, and would have happily done it again. There is nothing like sitting down with a piping hot bowl of Ramen on a cold day.  I went with their signature Tonkotsu Shio Ramen, and paired it with their combo deal which is a total no-brainer. For only a few bucks extra the Ramen came with a rice bowl (Cha-Shu Gohan) and a soft boiled egg (Aji-Tama) on the side. I thought the broth of the Ramen was complex and oh so delicious. Personally, I thought the meat in the soup was too fatty which was a distraction from the otherwise great bowl of Ramen. The side dishes were flavorful and paired perfectly with my steaming hot bowl of soup.  This restaurant is pretty small, so if you plan to head this way you better be prepared to wait. That being said, the chefs move quickly and all patrons have food in front of them pretty quickly which really helps the line outdoors to move along. Santouka's location in the Back Bay is a perfect place to take a pit-stop if you are doing some shopping on Newbury or at the Prudential. I'd happily recommend this spot to anyone looking for a good bowl of Ramen
Name: Tora Ramen; Review: Amazing ramen! Had a chance to taste good tonkatsu ramen after a long time. I had the kuro tonkatsu ramen which is very good . Probably better than all ramen places I have tried in Boston. The spicy miso ramen was very good too as told by my partner. Something I had never tried before was torched pork belly that came with the ramen and it was melt in mouth. we also ordered a side of kuro karaage which was very crunchy yet moist . Cash only and they accept tips with it
Name: Tao Ramen•Sushi; Review: First time here and I’m definitely coming back. I moved here from Boston and this place is one of the best ramen place I’ve seen so far. Now I don’t have to drive to Boston to get my ramen fix
Name: Pikaichi; Review: I had a bowl of miso ramen at Pikaichi at 11:30 this morning. It's 9:20 right now, and thinking about that bowl of ramen still makes my mouth water. Pikaichi doesn't feel like any kind of Dining Experience--it's in a food court, it's noisy, it's tiny, it's cheap. And the ramen was nothing special--just broth, noodles, pork, scallions, and some corn kernels, add some chili powder if you like. You could go to a joint that felt classy, cost more, and served you a prettier, more interesting bowl of ramen. I have. It was also good.  But today, during New England's complementary April snowstorm, this ramen sang to my soul. The broth was nutty, rich, and so thick I could almost sink my teeth into it. The corn, even though it wasn't the freshest, brought out the sweet, green notes of pork and seaweed and scallion in the broth. The pork was tender and perfectly seasoned. The generously provided noodles were chewy and slurpable. It was, in short, the most comforting food I have ever eaten, and I will take the memory of slurping those noodles and sipping that broth forward into the cold, windy world for at least the next couple days.  Go here with someone you love enough not to talk to and eat some ramen.  (On a more objective note, the takoyaki were tasty, but a little gluey.
Name: Tora Ramen; Review: I was here for the soft opening and was pleasantly surprised. I got the shiro ramen with double chashu ramen that was cooked perfectly via the sous vide. Very yummy broth and one of the best soft boiled eggs I’ve had in a long time. Totto ramen comes in a close second. You’ll find me here more often as I plan to try all the different kinds of ramen they offer","Name: Kappo Sushi and Ramen; Review: One of the top 5 best bowls of ramen I've had ever. The place is a little cramped, but the food came out delicious and quickly too. My friend and I came here after a long day as they were about to close but they took us anyways saying we were the last one so we manage to skip the usual line here. I felt that the portions for satisfying and the service was exceptional. Definitely would recommend this place to friends and famil
Name: RED WHITE BUDDHA RAMEN; Review: I had a terrific lunch here during the check-in to check out Yelp event (a free bowl in exchange for checking in on Yelp!). The space is nice and light filled, with colorful, pleasant decor. The staff is super friendly and helpful, even though I came in the afternoon after what I suspect was a busy lunch rush. They explained the bowl breakdown superbly, and I am amazed by all of the vegan and super tasty offerings!  The bowls start with a base of “white” or “red” rice but both the much more (carrots, broccoli, black beans, quinoa, etc) than just rice. I got the red rice and loved it! Next is the green, and I got a mix of kale and spinach. Then for the five toppings, they are split between categories like antiaging (includes squash, mushrooms, and beet and strawberry blend), recovery (includes cauliflower, eggplant) and power (corn, red peppers). Finally there is a sauce on top, and I opted for the Monk Curry which is super flavorful with a great soy sauce punch. And I got sesame seeds on top for crunch.  Overall, my experience was stellar, and I will definitely be back. Besides the bowls, they also offer super smoothies and Japanese tea that I will have to try next time. My experience with the Humble Bowls is that the price is super reasonable for the location, food quality, and portion! So excited to discover this new vegan spot :
Name: Yoki Express - Ramen & Poke Bowls; Review: If it weren't for seeing the staff having a lunch break, I would have thought this place was closed. It looks dark and gloomy looking in, but dine-in is definitely an option and I wouldn't worry about social distancing. We saw other customers walk in and out, or do take out. Their specialty seems to be sushi burritos, which I have to try next time. That being said, I opted for a poke bowl (first time!). To sum it up, it's pretty much a sushi in a bowl. I tried to put soy sauce and wasabi, but couldn't shake the contents in the bowl well. The Ninja Shuriken was really filling, didn't think I would finish it. On a side note...picked that item because it has a cool name, which tends to be how I pick what I eat
Name: Wen's Yunnan noodle and Ramen 过桥米线; Review: After putting our name in at another Ramen restaurant nearby (with over an hour wait), we decided to walk the streets in hopes of possibly finding an equally satisfying alternative. After a few minute walk we were able to find Wen.  Most tables were occupied and we were told ten minutes. Another waiter came over and combined to smaller tables to create accommodations for our party of 4. Water was waiting for us at our table which was nice.  The menu is small, but had rice noodle options and Ramen options. They also have a variety of extra things to put in your ramen for a fee. I was discussing my options with my husband when the waiter overhead and kindly clarified and explained one of the menu options better. This was super helpful!  We ordered fried dumplings for an appetizer. Usually when we've gotten them they are pan fried, bit these were deep fried, kind of similar to an empanada. They had a yummy pork filling. It was different than I am used to but delicious.  For my meal I ordered the Barbarian ramen which was beef flank, ramen, potatoes and carrots. When it arrived the portions were pretty good. I was disappointed to find no potatoes and carrots in my soup. And the beef was super fatty and chewy. I also didn't personally care for the spices used in my dish (maybe fennel? Or anise?) I don't like the licorice flavored spices and that's what mine tasted like so I was personally disappointed in my choice.  My husband and friends however were overall pretty happy with their choices. My cousin did have to order extra noodles (at a small cost) because she had a lot of broth left over.  Overall thoughts: service was kind and attentive, food came out very quickly, but a little disappointed overall for the meat quality of the beef. Portions were good and most of the table thought the food was ok-good, not super wowing. I think there are better choices and options in the nearby area
Name: Tora Ramen; Review: I had Kuro black garlic ramen $15 in cash only plus tip of course. It came with two slices nice thick cut of cha shum, over all it was good but I wish it came with a bit more ramen.

Name: Cappy's Pizza & Subs; Review: This was the worst experience I have ever had trying to order food. First I called and place my order and thought everything would be fine. I was told it would take 45 minutes to deliver.. after an hour and 15 minutes had passed I called again. the driver told me he had gone to the wrong address. So I called The Establishment and told them I was displeased but was still looking to get my pizza. They said all would be fine and after 20 minutes I received a phone call telling me that they do not deliver here. Even though I am local to them. My kids were waiting all night to eat pizza and at this point it was too late to order from anywhere else. My children were forced to eat ramen noodles and go to bed hungry. This is the most terrible experience I've ever had with a local establishment and would suggest no one to ever order here

Name: Tao Ramen•Sushi; Review: First time here and I’m definitely coming back. I moved here from Boston and this place is one of the best ramen place I’ve seen so far. Now I don’t have to drive to Boston to get my ramen fix

Name: Soup Shack JP; Review: A ramen spot in Jamaica Plain? Yes, please! But don't go calling this a ramen-only joint, because they serve all kinds of noodz over there, from Japanese ramen bowls to Thai noodle soups, rice bowls, and plenty of other Asian-inspired dishes.  Being cold and famished, I went with a roasted pork steamed bun ($4) and one of their Tan Tan Men bowls ($12) and proceeded to sit down and look outside their large, front-of-the-store window for my food to get prepped up and arrive.  My pork steamed bun was pretty good but what they don't tell you, is that it's not your typical chashu pork - they use a pork-belly cut which is much, much fattier. They used it in my appetizer as well as in my ramen. I don't mind a lil fat here and there but this proved too much for me. It was good but not as good as the more traditional cuts you get which have more meat.  But it was all decent and the bowl of Tan Tan Men was pretty damn tasty outside of those super fatty pork slides. The broth had great depth of flavor and I slurped it all up in minutes.  The price is about right and the service was great. The place is cute but all they have is counter-style seating which means that groups of more than two will probably not have the best time hanging out there and trying to talk, etc.."
Thai curry takeout options,"Name: House of Siam; Review: Well it's a nice place as long as you don't order any Thai food. Ambience was nice, food not nice at all. We ordered yellow curry and drunk noodles. My curry was completely cold/ room temperature and had to be sent back. It was yellow colored water with excessive vegetables in it. It did not taste like yellow curry at all!!! We ordered both dishes mild and drunken noodles were at least level 4 hot. To add more to the bad experience waitress was not really bothered about the whole thing. The restaurant was not busy, only 2 tables. Anything but the Thai experience
Name: Wonder Spice Cafe; Review: We went one night, and loved it so much we came back again the next night. We both got the Southern Pad Thai the first night. It was pad thai made with curry spices, and it was amazing. The second night I got the normal pad thai, it was a bit under flavored, at least in comparison to the southern pad thai, but still good
Name: Riceberry; Review: Yeah a new Thai restaurant that is delicious and friendly.  Had fried dumplings, wild boar basil and Panang curry and all were very good.  The curry was spicy but not over the top.  Wine selection was decent too.  Seating is limited but comfy and cozy
Name: Chilli Duck; Review: I love Thai food and usually find Pad Thai to be good but boring. However, I went to Chili Duck and the first time I ordered Drunken Noodles which were good but my friend had the Pad Thai and it was out of this world good. Now every time I go I get the pad thai, chicken satay, and extra peanut sauce (which is also better than almost anywhere else I've been). The place is decent sized, I've never had to wait and they are good about call in take out orders. It's definitely my new favorite Thai plac
Name: Pad Thai Cafe; Review: Not the best. Ordered seafood panang curry and received a huge plate of rice with a few pieces of seafood and veggies. I requested more curry sauce as I didn’t expect them to mix the curry and rice. I’m on the keto diet and a plate of rice was not acceptable. I was charged an addition $4 for curry sauce and told to order the dinner portion. Despite charging me dinner prices, I never received the dinner portion. Also, you have to clean your own plate so don’t add a tip. I ended up ruining my dress because I’m not used to cleaning my own plate at a restaurant. It was too late for me, I had already added the tip at check out. If you can find another Thai restaurant, I recommend trying there","Name: Thai Dish Restaurant; Review: They have the fastest, yet most delicious take out I've seen. Ten minutes and your food is hot and packaged up, ready to go. Hearty lunches of curry and rice are under $10. The staff is always pleasant and the food has never disappointed. The restaurant itself is a little funny, with fish and waterfalls and other strange decor, but it's charming. It's a great, tasty, simple restaurant
Name: Thai Dish; Review: I stopped at Thai Dish for lunch today.  Very small place just off  Commonwealth Avenue. Extensive menu, you order at the counter for sit-down or take-out.  I ate by the window (I was the only customer at that hour)  I began with a generous bowl of the Tom Kha Gai Soup, slices of chicken with mushrooms in light coconut milk flavored with galangal, chilies and lime $4.25.  The unique flavors of the galanga and lime combined with the slightly sweet coconut milk make this soup one of my favorites.  Then I had the Pickpow bowl with choice of meat (my choice a chicken) slightly spicy, delicious sautéed with chili sauce with  mushrooms, carrots,  red peppers, scallions, and baby corn. $10.  Served with a huge bowl of white rice.  The portion as large and I took half home.  The food was so good I wanted to try their Chicken Pad Thai.  I took one order to go. Rice noodles stir fried with tamarind sauce, fish sauce, egg scallion. $9.25  The place is immaculate, the staff very friendly and accommodating.  And be sure to visit the Super 88 Hong Kong Asian Market right around the corner after your meal

I get the massaman curry and a Thai iced tea every time I go, and every single time, I’ve cleared the container (which I never do)! They’re a decent train ride away from my apartment but they’re absolutely worth the trip. I always carry out since being around people I don’t know who are maskless (patrons eating, never the staff), and they’re always speedy!

Name: Kapow Thai Cuisine; Review: The food was tasty.. I really enjoyed it. However, note to staff: every delivery should include utensils no matter what.  Normally I wouldn't care, but I was out getting my hair done with at least 2 more hours to go and they don't have utensils at a hair salon.

VERY good food.  I got Satay Chicken app (very curry heavy on the marinade) and the peanut sauce was fantastic. Then the Hangover Noodles w/Beef. That spicy Thai goodness with this really savory brown sauce. I can definitely see that being a hangover cure!  Wife got the Chicken Dumplings app and they were stellar. Crazy crispy wonton wrapper and deep flavor inside. For her entree, Cashew Nut Chicken w/jasmine rice. She was in love. Nice warmth and heat, lots of flavor.  Son got Shrimp Pad Thai. Exactly what you would expect from an authentic Thai place, very well prepared, great balance of flavor.  Portions were great. Easy to make 2 meals of with self control, or have some for snack later in the night (maybe next morning with those Hangover Noodles :)) I finished the app and just over half the entrée and I was almost over full.  Only enough seating for maybe 15 people? 2 2 tops, 3 4 tops, and a counter with 4 or 5 stools that were more of a takeaway waiting area. One girl doing takeout and waiting on tables, could get dicey when this place takes off.  Looking like more of a takeout spot or for groups of 2-4 for eating in, but make no mistake, it's worth the trip

Name: Siam Bistro; Review: One of the best places to eat in Boston's Waterfront this is a No Frills authentic style Thai restaurant with great flavors and great spices to go along with those great flavors the fish sauce the curries and the noodles that great dishes to have. The Tamarind duck is a favorite along with the crispy chicken Thai basil the curries are not bad as well having flavor spice and aromantic smells and taste. The Drunken Noodles are not bad but not their best dish but good. I highly recommend trying this Bistr

Name: Nud Pob Thai Cuisine; Review: Like most Thai/Chinese restaurants, there are LOTS of options here, so most will find something they'll enjoy. I'm partial to fried rice, and there's plenty of options there so I can vary my orders. All of the fried rice options are great, but I can't say the same for others dishes, as I haven't tried them.  Prices are decent, considering you get so much food. There is a $10 minimum for card purchases, so unless you have cash, you won't be spending any less than $10 here. It can very well be split into two meals, however.  The service is friendly and speedy. They don't seem to speak the greatest English, but that's completely fine provided you don't have some kind of strange request, or if you have some kind of particular allergy.  There seems to be lots of seating here, which is nice. It definitely gets full around lunchtime, though. All in all, nice place to grab some good Thai food; just wish the prices could come down a bit, or they could remove that card minimum

Name: Thai Dish; Review: Love it. Small mom and pop thai place with great prices and for my money, best thai food in the area. Brown Sugar right around the corner is not only worse tasting, but more expensive.  The more I eat here, the more I am pleased. Excellent curries, soups (love it with a little sour and spice), duck fried rice and drunken noodle. Plus the mango sticky rice dessert was outstanding.  Service in the summer here has been excellent, I'm a man in need of many water refills and they provide. The best part is definitely the taste of the food

Italian cannoli places nearby,"Name: Italian Express Pizzeria; Review: I love Italian pizzeria express. No where in Boston can you get delicious food from a 5-star restaurant and pay a very reasonable price. Other Italian restaurants in Boston can be very expensive but the quality and taste isn't on par with Italian pizzeria express. What i love the most about this place is that it doesn't matter what your economic background is, whether you're a broke college student or from a hardworking blue collar family, anyone can afford and enjoy a meal wealthy people would normally overpay for at a reasonable price and leave very full.  My girlfriend and i have been here at least 6 times, and we've never had a bad meal here. I would ignore any reviews that is below a 4 star rating, because either those people are impossible to please, difficult, or they don't know what good food taste like.  Below is my breakdown as to why this is the best Italian restaurant in all of Boston.  Price: 5/5 Most Italian places charge at least $20 per entree dish and the portions aren't that good. The most expensive entree dish at Italian Pizzeria express is $22, the frutti dimare, but it's loaded various fresh seafood and a ton of pasta. Seriously, it's a meal for 2 people at $22.  Quality: 5/5 I've had the pleasure of speaking with Jim, the owner of this restaurant, and he is someone who takes pride in his food. The olive oil he uses is imported from Italy. He makes his pasta and other food from scratch. He uses mascarpone cheese for his ravioli, so that the ravioli has a smooth taste. The man spares no expenses when it comes to serving delicious food. The desserts are amazing. My girlfriend loves red velvet cakes, and she said that the red velvet cake at Italian pizzeria is the best she's ever had. The homemade cannoli is THE BEST cannoli, I've ever tasted in Boston (and I've tried Mike's pastries and Modern pastries). When I spoke with the co-owner Jim recently, he mentioned that he makes the cannoli filling himself and that his brother makes the red velvet cake from scratch, even the cream cheese filling for the cake. However, there are days when the owner isn't in and the quality of the food dips slightly, but not enough to be super noticeable.  Service: 4.5/5 If the owner Jim is working, then you'll get excellent service and leave with a great experience. Other staff can be inconsistent, some are great and some are not as friendly. Some are prompt and others can be forgetful.  Overall, this is the best Italian restaurant in all of Boston. I love that they do a good job keeping the prices down so anyone can enjoy a delicious meal and leave full and happy
Name: Monica's Mercato; Review: Complete frauds... While the products are of good quality and authentic, the store presents itself as a real Italian shop. Meanwhile, not one person in that shop could even count to ten in Italian. My wife is from Italy and went to the deli to ask if they had a specific Italian meat. They guy behind the counter didn't even know what she said and couldn't even pronounce it. Of course he ended up saying no with a confused face. There was an old woman in there the last time I went who only spoke Italian. You would think that ""Monica's Mercato"" would surely have at least one person to come and speak to her and help her, but no. Everyone looked at her confused and I had to interpret for her. While I understand that nowadays it would be difficult to find a staff full of Italian speakers, if you're going to represent yourself as some authentic Italian shop in the heart of an Italian neighborhood, there should be something Italian about your shop aside from ""Prodotto di Italia"" written on the label. Just another fraudulent,  fake Italian spot
Name: La Summa; Review: I can't speak highly enough of La Summa! The pasta is perfectly cooked and has a texture to die for... The wine selection is a nice selection of Sicilians and Tuscan wines which complements to the food to a T.. (Had a 2012 Chianti Classico- really nice price for the quality.) Now we don't usually get dessert but we splurged and split the cannoli dessert (which came out as two smaller cannoli's). It was the best cannoli I've ever had... The filling was freshly made for us at order, which I don't know if that is always the case, but WOW, it almost brought a tear to my eye... I'm so glad we splurged! To be super critical: The one thing I was a little disappointed in was our starter, a caprese salad. We felt portion was on the small side and the quality of the tomatoes was not there. The tomatoes didn't have the fresh taste I was looking for and the texture was a little too tough. (We ate here the first week of August which is a prime time for MA tomato season)  +They take credit cards ++They are a AAdvantage restaurant partner (3point per dollar!) +++They are not touristy/Yet easy to find! Perfect for a date night
Name: Linguine's Italian Eatery; Review: Basically everyone in the local office of my company insisted that I try this restaurant, and I’m so glad I took their advice! The food was excellent, and judging on how busy it was (and how many people told me to go there), it’s clear that this is a huge hit for the locals of the area. Nigel took care of my table and highly recommended the cannoli when the time for dessert came around. I got it with chocolate chips and immediately understood why. The shell was fresh and made locally, and the cream is made from scratch in house. There’s nothing particularly fancy about this restaurant except the food, and that’s not a bad thing at all. It’s a cozy place to enjoy some great authentic Italian food. I’ll say it like I was told: If you are in Marlborough and like Italian food, you HAVE to try Linguine’s
Name: Prezza; Review: Had my bday dinner there last week (Friday). Given the high marks I was really looking forward to an outstanding meal, but I found the meatballs and mushroom soup to be very bland.  The rigaoni with mushrooms, shallots, parmigiana and spec to be way too salty, the creme brulee bland with a burnt aftertaste and the homemade cannoli was runny and bland (should have gone to Modern).  Overall a disappointment.  Others in my party agreed on the creme brulee, cannoli, and meatalls.  Many didn't like the olive oil saying it had a bad after taste.  I expected more for the price","Name: Carmelina's; Review: The night before we came here for dinner here we went to a cafe across the street and asked our server for a recommendation for a good Italian restaurant in the area. Without hesitation, she pointed across the street to Carmelina's. So we decided to give it try. We made a reservation, which is recommended. When we arrived, we were kindly greeted at the door and brought to our table. Which had plastic wall separators between tables due to covid. The server had alot of knowledge on the food and drink menu. He was great, very sweet and checked on use multiple time throughout our time there. Made sure we had water in our cups the entire time and even came to pour more wine in our glass from our bottle on the table when it was low. The pasta itself was also fresh and you can definitely tell the difference when it's not. Our food was served really fast, which was great because we were hungry!!! The portions were very big. Everything was hot and tasted absolutely amazing, I'm Italian and very picky when it comes to eating out for Italian food. The atmosphere was cute, being able to see into the kitchen was really cool too. Can't wait to come visit Boston and eat here again!!! 10/10 recommend!
Name: Caffe Lil Italy; Review: Quaint family coffee shop serving AMAZING coffee, and yummy breakfast sandwiches. Their lattes are strong, and perfectly made. They also have desserts, muffins, and paninis. Friendly staff, lots of seating, and the perfect view of Old North Church
Name: CINIS; Review: Tried this place while visiting Boston because I heard they have the best balls in Boston. Very nice staff and orders made fresh right in front of you. I ordered the buffalo chicken arancinis, pepperoni pizza and a Philly cheesesteak calzone. We didn't love the Buffalo arancinis, they were too breaded or not enough filling but I would definitely try a different filling if I go back to Boston. The calzone was stuffed and super fresh! We loved how cheesy the pizza and calzone were. Definitely try this place!!
Name: Antonio's Cucina Italiano; Review: Literally paying the check as I write this. Great pour on the wine, food was delicious and the atmosphere is just lovely. First, waiter sat me and allowed me to put in an appetizer order as I waited for the rest of my party (3 more) and made sure I was well taken care of. He tended to every beck and call and was very honest about the pasta not being cooked to order (no aldiente) but made plenty of alternate suggestions. We asked about the desserts made in house, tiramisu and cannoli, and tried both. Cannoli: so creamy, amazing vanilla taste (no lemon thank god!), crispy fresh shell. The tiramisu: amazing, lady fingers soaked just enough...drooling all over again. Food was simple and delicious (sometimes needed some salt) but overall what a pleasant well portioned and adequately priced surprise

Name: Carmelina's; Review: Overall: Carmelina's successfully provides great food and charm in a competitive neighborhood.  The good: We started with fried calamari and even though I was wary of it being the stereotypical offering found in most places, it was cooked extremely well and not overdone. It was also served with capers and peppers, which provided a nice kick to the usual taste. No side of marinara either, which I respect. Then we split the rolatti di pasta between the two of us, and it was not only fantastic from a taste perspective but also the perfect portion for two. It truly tasted authentic from all sides, from the pasta and cheeses to the sauce that it was swimming in.  The not-so-good: The waitresses were rather unattentive at times, especially when we originally wanted to order. The prices for roughly half of the entrees were rather high, even though the food was great. Not a ton of seating, so you're likely to wait (we got lucky)  Atmosphere: 8/10 Service: 7.5/10 Food: 8.5/1

Name: Casalinga; Review: Being an Italian raised in East Boston I rarely find authentic Italian cuisine when I dine out. This is not the case at Casalinga. The arincinis ( rice balls ) are delicious, the lobster ravioli tender and flavorful, and the eggplant parmesan wonderful. Superb quality Italian cooking at a very reasonable price. A hidden gem","Name: Libertine; Review: Excellent food service and drinks !!!! If you’re in the city it’s a must try. Fun, casual, friendly atmosphere with hands down THE BEST Arancini you will ever have!!! Not to mention the insanely delicious cannoli ice cream sandwich ! Magnificent food and service !! Well done Libertine

Name: Caffé Lavazza at Eataly; Review: A very rich but very powerful chocolate, not suitable for diabetics or diets. Delicious canolis. Quick and attentive attention. To improve: the time for cleaning the tables and stocking the counters with take away products.

Name: Italian Express Pizzeria; Review: I love Italian pizzeria express. No where in Boston can you get delicious food from a 5-star restaurant and pay a very reasonable price. Other Italian restaurants in Boston can be very expensive but the quality and taste isn't on par with Italian pizzeria express. What i love the most about this place is that it doesn't matter what your economic background is, whether you're a broke college student or from a hardworking blue collar family, anyone can afford and enjoy a meal wealthy people would normally overpay for at a reasonable price and leave very full.  My girlfriend and i have been here at least 6 times, and we've never had a bad meal here. I would ignore any reviews that is below a 4 star rating, because either those people are impossible to please, difficult, or they don't know what good food taste like.  Below is my breakdown as to why this is the best Italian restaurant in all of Boston.  Price: 5/5 Most Italian places charge at least $20 per entree dish and the portions aren't that good.

Name: Modern Underground; Review: A hidden gem. You'll almost miss the entrance but the underground bar is a great speakeasy. It's the one thing that Mike's Pastry hasn't got.  The bar has the usual variety of drinks, food is good and you have got to finish off with the cannolis.  Afternoons are the best time to visit. More of a sports bar feel with the TVs tuned to sports, when a game is going on"
Indian naan delivery,"Name: Punjab Palace; Review: While i was hunting for an good indian restaurant with true indian flavour and spices in boston area. I found this restaurant on brighton ave and just  came to try it once. It was on friday evening crowded with many people. I had recieved a great welcome from this guys. I ordered  palak paneer with some garlic bread and it was served with great taste. Mango lassi was really awesome. These guys also do home delivery and they are very sure about 40 min delivery time. It was like another good news for me, where i can get food from the best restaurant within 40 minutes. I would like to rate this restaurant as top indian retaurant where i could not found this taste in the other retaurants which i visited near this area. My friends from different countries like indian food and they all keep asking me the best indian restaurant, so now i can proudly suggest this restaurant for best indian tasty food. Thanks for the management and staff for serving the best indian food
Name: Boston Catering; Review: Loved it! Service was great and we were made to feel at home. The portions were a nice size with plenty to take home for left overs. We got the chicken tikka masala and the lamb vindaloo, with some garlic naan and veggie samosas. That naan was FRESH! We'll be coming back next time we're craving Indian
Name: D'Guru; Review: Authentic, if a little overpriced, Indian food for lunch.  I appreciate that they cater to the western palate without losing the flavors of India. Some spicy and gentler dishes. Also like that they offer rice and naan together for us hungry savages. You won't leave hungry!  Just wish they offered one size down for servings (currently it's two entrees, rice and naan for about $11-$12, wish they offered one entree and either rice or naan for ~$7 - would be there daily!
Name: Mehak Halal Cuisine; Review: This is definitely a hidden gem. If you only look at the photos, you may not want to try it and that is mistake! I gave it a four star because there was basically no service in this place and the ambience wasn’t nice, but the food was fantastic.  A few tips: Bring someone who can speak Punjabi with you, so they can communicate. The waiter/cook speaks broken English. Not everything on the menu is available, so ask them before you order. This is a CASH ONLY place! You don’t come here for the service. You may need to ask for a fork if you need.  There are three must order dishes: mango lassi, keema naan, and shammi kebabs. I have tried so many Indian restaurants, and I can guarantee you this is the best mango lassi in Boston. You can feel that you are drinking real mango. But the mango lassi here is very thick and filling, so just keep that in mind. My husband is Indian and he was so addicted to it as well. We also ordered garlic naan, but my husband and our Punjabi friend said it was okay, no where compared to the keema naan. I don’t know how they can make the meat so fine and almost melted inside the naan. Genius
Name: Halal Indian Cuisine; Review: Where do I begin with this place. From the horrible quality food to the unfriendly staff who overcharged me on two separate occasions for a side item that was supposed to be included in the meal per the menu. Calling the food comparable to frozen Indian food would be disrespectful frozen Indian food from the grocery store. This is the worst tasting Indian food I have ever tried. If your that desperate for Indian food and live in the Brigham Circle area there are plenty of Indian restaurants with take out that deliver to this area with higher quality food FYI","Name: D'tandoor; Review: Had butter chicken. Still can't find one like my dads. They use a lot of tomato sauce rather using heavy cream or sour cream. Very little butter used. First thing is color, butter chicken is light orange. This was dark red and I got medium spice. The biriyani also had too much anise star seasoning. I had one bite and that's all I could taste. I also asked for boneless and they gave me with bone and not much meat. Indian people: just ask your parents or grandparents to make you food. I've been to over 30 Indian restaurants in Mass and they all don't have good curry. Like its not that hard. White people won't complain because they don't know much in the same way Indians don't know if Italian food is good outside. Save your money, eat at home or your aunties
Name: Gourmet India; Review: The service was very fast and friendly, and I thought the prices were fine considering the location and the amount of food you get. It's great to have an Indian option in Faneuil Hall, and u was looking forward to trying it. Unfortunately I thought the food was very bland and watery. I got a combo plate with chicken vindaloo and saag paneer and both were disappointing and really missing the flavor I was hoping for. The vindaloo, though they warned me it was spicy, was not spicy at all to me.  I didn't try the naan but it didn't look tempting from what I could see.  A bit disappointing overall
Name: Paani; Review: Vegetarian review: There is an Uttar Pradesh touch to the food - just something to point out as a differentiating factor. You get the option of Lucknowi Awadhi entrees.  Caution: When this restaurant says spicy, they mean spicy. Consider yourself warned if you would never order spicy in India.  The baghara baingan (eggplant) was superb! Amongst the best I've had in the US. The paneer tikka masala was also very good and they can make it without nuts as an FYI. The paneer kofta appetizer is also very good. The green chutney served with it is real coriander/cilantro and not the watered-down yogurtized garbage typically placed on restaurant tables in the US. The mango lassi was also excellent.  Now the stuff that lost it a star: The lachcha parantha and the naan were poor. I believe the chef lack the skill to make good naan because it tasted and felt like one made using a frozen Deep packet (which is also ironically better when done right)
Name: Punjab Palace; Review: Pretty terrible first experience with Punjab Palace. I Ordered delivery, which I guess always comes with some risk. I ordered through Grubhub and was informed that the delivery would be late, then was notified it would be late again. When I was notified my order was picked up and on the way, it was delivered in a timely manner. When I opened my order, it had the correct appetizer, and an entree that was no where near what I ordered. I couldn't tell you what entree I received, but I'm fairly certain chicken curry isn't dark green. And the extra I paid for garlic naan was met with naan. So my entire experience was 1hr wait for food preparation, 10min delivery, and 1/3 of my order delivered. After 1 hour, I think it's fair to expect the order to be correct. Instead, I received a meal that they needed to send out. I would have given it a second star if it satisfied my crave for Indian cuisine
Name: Halal Indian Cuisine; Review: I visited this place on a Friday afternoon with my wife. We ordered chicken tandoori with garlic naan and 2 lassi. First, the lassi was not chilled. Second, the food was a disaster. It seemed they gave us microwaved left overs from the previous night. The chicken was hard and had a weird taste to it. Moreover, the place wasn't exactly 'clean' and we had to eat with a fly buzzing around. And this experience cost us almost 30 dollars. Please don't go to this place unless you have absolutely no other option","Name: D'tandoor; Review: Had butter chicken. Still can't find one like my dads.

We ordered the Garlic Naan and Basmati rice to which they gave is a complementary side of  Chicken Tiki Masala. The food was excellent and the staff were even better. Friendly and helpful. The Naan was soft and flavorful and the chicken and sauce was perfectly seasoned and not over spiced. We also ordered  the Villa Special pizza than was more than delicious and loaded with fresh toppings. I would definitely be sure to stop in any time your looking for fresh delicious Curries and Pizza. If your not sure what to order just ask they are very happy to explain everything and help you find a dish you are sure to love

Name: Bollywood Grill; Review: I have grown up on Indian food all of my life, and I love everything about it, in the hundreds of different Indian restaurants I have eaten in/from this is single-handedly the worst I have ever been to. The portions were so small you'd be lucky to fill a 10 year old child, prices were so steep given the portion sizes, the food served did not represent what was ordered and tasted (honestly) foul. I ordered 1 main dish, 3 sides and a Naan bread and every last one of them had a distinct chemical taste. One of the side dishes ordered was Chicken Pakora, which for the most part was chicken, however, several pieces were Shrimp, whilst this wasn't what we wanted or ordered it wasn't a massive issue - but it could be should you be allergic to shell fish (fair warning!). All in all, I will never eat there again, ever. I highly recommend if you're reading this to eat elsewhere. If I could give less than one star I would.  - Dishes tasted days old - No particular flavor to the food other than an overriding chemical taste - Naan may as well have been a flattened Sara Lee loaf - Shocked Zagat rated it as anything above zer

Name: Bollywood Grill; Review: Worst experience here. Terrible Customer service and horrifying food. Disgrace to Indian food, Indian hospitality. In general I avoid Indian restaurants because I have seen they royally screw Indian food in an attempt to please the international crowd; I was tired after a long week in CA and wanted to have some plain dal chawal. Their dal costs $14 which is atrocious. And it comes in a tiny bowl, not even enough for one person. I asked for a drink called Kamasutra from their menu and he gave me the most shameful look. I ordered Bollywood naan and chicken 65 because that was the only dry option. The chicken 65 arrived but no naan or the drink. Then I had to call and remind them about the drink and naan. The naan arrived raw/30% uncooked. The chicken 65 recipe was screwed in the worst way. The family at the table next to me were equally dissatisfied with their veg meals and swore never to come back. Anybody with an Indian tastebud should not attempt this place. Anyone who wants to try Indian food for the first time please don't attempt this place because you will be scarred for life. And to top it all, I was made to change tables after I was seated at one by one of their waiters for no apparent reason

Name: JMP Fine Indian Cuisine; Review: The very best Indian food in Boston. I have had the biriyani from here and every single time, it's been delectable! The spice, the rice and the meat is on point. No Peas in the rice, as some supposed Indian restaurants have presented it with. The quantity is quite satisfactory too!  I've had a samosa chaat as well, which was surprisingly good. Oh, the cherry on top? They get Indo-Chinese dishes(which is a VERY different thing from authentic Chinese) exactly right

Name: Vaanga Boston; Review: Picked up an order on 3/18, I was told that they will take 20 minutes for the order. It took close to an hour, I literally had to wait outside from 7:49 pm to 8:34 pm. Server need to be honest, I ordered Shahi Paneer and Channa Tikka Masala. When I reached home to my surprise gravy was same for both  Paneer and Channa, that was still ok. But there was no Channa in Channa tikka masala. Rice and Naan were cold and stale. This is not the way you guys should do Business. If I had an option I would have given zero star. I will never recommend anyone to try this restaurant"
I’m looking for Mexican street taco stands,"Name: Pueblo Viejo; Review: El Pueblo Viejo makes the most delicious pupusas I’ve tasted so far here in Massachusetts. This is my family’s first option for pupusas. But I’ve also tried some of their Mexican dishes, I’d say their Mexican dishes are not typical Mexican food it’s more like Taco Bell. However, this is a great restaurant to take your family. Great service, the ladies are always polite and attentive. I wish I could give 5 stars but you guys need to improve on your Mexican dishes. I do recommend this restaurant
Name: Tavitas Mexican; Review: I visited for ""Taco Tuesday,"" which is advertised as an all-you-can-eat taco night. The choices are very limited, though - you have to pick either chicken or carnitas, and can't switch to the other type of taco at any point during your meal. The tacos come with fermented vegetables (onion, cabbage, carrot) on them, which is fine if you're ordering a sandwich from Bon Me, but which is not so good when trying to enjoy a Mexican meal.  In addition, a small serving chips and salsa costs $5, plus $2 more any time you want more chips.  I wouldn't eat here again
Name: Tenoch Mexican; Review: Somewhat disappointing lunch experience. Having seen the strong reviews, I was optimistic and looking forward to some delicious Mexican food.  Chips/Guac/Salsa: 2/5 The chips were pretty bland with no salt on them. The guac was actually quite good, but could have used some additional seasoning. The salsa was the most disappointing part of the entire meal. It tasted like canned tomato sauce with a few pieces of fresh diced tomatoes and onion. Not great..  Burrito: 3/5 I did not have this meal, but my friend did. It was quite large, but was overwhelmingly rice, beans and cheese. Needed more veggies.  Tacos: 3/5 The fish taco was ok. I had taken it to go, so by the time I ate it, it was a bit soggy. There was a smoky sauce of some sort which kind of threw me off, as I was expecting more brighter/citrus flavors for a fish taco. Pastor taco was good. The chicken was a bit dry but complimented well with pineapple. The last taco I had was the Campechano. This was the best of the three. The chorizo and carnitas were juicy and flavorful!  Alas.
Name: The Place; Review: This place is dooshbag central. Just a buncha losers, hanging around, grabbing at chicks, and sucking down overpriced drinks. I hate it and all that it stands for. What exactly it stands for is undetermined at this time, but nonetheless, once that is discovered, hatred will grow on that as well
Name: Chilacates Centre St; Review: As someone who’s in love with Austin Texas and it’s plethora of taco options, I’m always on the lookout for a great place to get tacos. Chilacates, both locations that I’ve been to (Centre street and Amory street in JP), are amazing. Prices are reasonable. Quick, chill environment with a small storefront.  The biggest thing for me, homemade corn tortillas. To die for.  I’ll often stop by here when they open at 9 on the weekends and get a breakfast taco (just eggs and pico) and a papas con chorizo, smother them both in the green and orange hot sauces. Just watch as they magically disappear from your plate.  My other favorites are the Al Pastor tacos as well as the hidden gem: Tamales. Their tamales are amazing. They usually have 3 kinds, pork chicken or cheese. Just get one or two to add to your taco smorgasbord, open those bad boys up, smother in pico and both hot sauces, enjoy!  Though I’m more of a taco guy, I have friends who swear by their burritos and I can say with confidence that this is the best torta I’ve ever had. Usually at a Mexican place, I think it’s a waste of time if you’re not getting tacos, but for real, you can’t go wrong with a torta.  I’m enamored with this place, so, so glad to have it nearby.

Name: Taco Mania; Review: Go here for the traditional TORTAS. Absolutely melt in ur mouth good. These r spanish sadwitches filled w shredded chicken/steak, shreded lettuce, tomatoes,& avacados in a traditional spanish sub roll (super soft) thats lightly  toasted w butter. Addictive. Its also very low cost =) . And their Liquados (milkshakes ) are phenomenal, cant chose  wrong, all outstanding and fresh. They also have a buffet which looks kinda mediocre.... and their pupusas are bland. I'd give them 5 stars on just the torta but i have to mention the other items to be fair. Highly  recommended
Name: Taco Mex Restaurant; Review: Stumbled into this one without any pre-knowledge and were so happy with the results! Fresh ingredients, a caring staff and a quick service made this a memorable meal for sure. We got the Chicken Nachos and a Taco sampler and both were full of flavor. The freshly used vegetables mixed with perfectly cooked chicken and beef created a very satisfying Mexican Food lunch. The prices were a little high for no offering of chips or anything else, but other than that, we had an excellent meal and we will definitely go back when we're in town again
Name: Taco Mex Restaurant; Review: I love coming here, i live in peabody and make it a point to drive here at least 4 times a month, they have best tacos, shrimp ceviche and a huge menu that i havent been able to get thru but i will.

Second, the restaurant offers a variety of tacos with your choice of corn (soft or hard) or flour. They also offer tortas (Mexican sandwich) and a selection of flavored waters. We both had a pescado (fish) taco. My wife and another al pastor while I opted for the chicharrón (crispy pork skin). Definitely get the chicharrón if you like pork - it’s amazing. We shared a torta with carnitas. It was delicious, and full as we were toward the end we did not leave anything on our plate. This was worth the drive to Boston from the Merrimack Valley area.

Name: Dorado Tacos Boston; Review: Dorados is a great place for quick street tacos, among other delicious tex-mex inspired foods. While they seem to have shrunk a bit since they first opened, the quality of the tacos has remained intact. My favorite is the Baha inspired fish tacos. They have a regular and spicy version, and each includes beer battered Pollack, plus salsa fresca, pickled veggies and crema. They have a great deal where you can order a meal including two tacos, rice, beans and a charred jalapeno. Another great unique item are their Cemetas - sandwiches with your choice of meat, chipotles in adobo sauce, avocado, Oaxaca cheese, black beans and cilantro.  If you are around on their weekend, they also have a nice little brunch. The place is small with limited seating outside, and on nice days, a few tables outside where you can people watch until your heart's content","Name: Loco Taqueria & Oyster Bar; Review: TACO TUESDAY @ LOCO: Their tacos that usually cost $5-6 a piece, they were cut down to $2-$3.50 a taco (think 50% off).  Keep in mind that other people are also aware of this amazing deal, so this place will be packed and noisy.  We ""vultured"" two spots at the bar after hearing there was a 45 minute wait, and even so there were plenty of people without seats at all, just standing around the bar with their cocktails.  Food highlights: *Grilled Street Corn* appetizer, *Baja Fried Fish Taco*, and the *Cola Pork Carnitas Taco.*  We also tried the Chicken Tinga, Grilled Avocado, and Fried Pork -- would not recommend these.  *Grilled Street Corn* is juicy, charred, and sweet, drizzled in a garlic and chili mojo sauce that vaguely reminded me of chipotle mayo but better.  SO GOOD.  So sad there were only three (aka I'm too broke to buy more of these.)  The *Fish Taco* and *Carnitas Taco* have an excellent ratio of textures and flavors: crunch and juicy; umami and tangy.  After being very underwhelmed by our first taco (aka the dried mess they call the Pork Taco), the fish taco stood as PERFECTION in contrast -- it's been a while since I've had such a delicate, yet satisfying crunch.  The carnitas taco was deeply satisfying in flavor; they drew out the umami of the meat and brightened it with sweetness (pineapple salsa), and crunch (mini tortilla chips).  IN SUM: I'm pretty satisfied!  Yes, they are busy, cramped, extremely noisy, and their service exists only in its bare bones (I've heard they're pretty packed on non-promo days too).  However, the hit menu items will have you CRAVING them for a long while.  Definitely give this place a try

Name: Taquería Jalisco; Review: DINNER REVIEW  Taco bout a great find!  I came to Taqueria Jalisco on the recommendation of a friend who lives in Eastie and boy am I glad I did. I just got back from a week-long trip to Mexico and I have to say...these tacos were better than any tacos I had in Mexico.  They were full of juicy, flavorful meat (I had one chicken, one steak, and one marinated pork) and topped with cilantro and onion. The steak was my favorite but they were all good. Then you have the option of one of their three multi-colored salsa (green, brown, yellow) with varying degrees of spiciness to add to your tacos (none were too spicy for me but those who don't like spice should stick to the green). The rice and beans that came with it were also great.  I also had a pork tamale which was a good tamale but I think the tacos were still my favorite.  The place is tiny so you may have to wait a bit for a table (we waited 5 minutes only) and the service is great (the servers are so nice!). You can easily get FULL for under $20 which is great too.  I will definitely be back

Name: Chilacates Amory St; Review: There's a saying that: ""A good taco doesn't need cheese. A good taco only needs a little bit of lime and cilantro."" This statement is true when it comes to this place - which is a huge compliment since Boston is famous for its lack of authentic, good taco  restaurants. (Came with a mexican friend who had been searching for good tacos in Boston for a long time.) Got 4 tacos with 4 different fillings: Al pastor (pork with pineapple), Papa's con chorizo (potatoes and meat), lengua (beef tongue), and pork en Chile Verde (carnitas in salsa). Homemade taco shells - fresh, warm, thick and soft without that grainy texture. All the meat were super tender and juicy. The Papa's con chorizo didn't blow me away - could taste more potatoes than chorizo (if any). But I would definitely come back to get the Al pastor and pork en Chile Verde. Also got the horchata which was delicious! It reminded of sweetened almond milk with cinnamon. If you don't like cinnamon, don't get this drink. My friend got the quesadilla with the Papa's con chorizo. Wasn't blown away with it but we think it's because of the filling. The potatoes were too plain - not enough flavors. Good amount of melted cheese and the guac is perfect. Very filling meal, delicious, and it can get Super messy since the filling will topple out of the taco shell with every bite - but no complaints there. 😉 The space is small. Only counter space to eat with maybe 7 chairs. Service is great and fast"
Can you find Brunch buffet places nearby?,"Name: Pao Brasil Bakery; Review: First time eating there and their buffet was DELICIOUS!  Going back Saturday!
Name: Sauciety Restaurant; Review: Sold us on a $25 per person buffet right at closing time. They were out of bacon and closed the buffet within 10 minutes of sitting down. Atmosphere was nice. Server was nice enough but would have been good to know that after spending 25 bucks on breakfast the buffet would be closing. Also felt rushed out. Would not return
Name: Tandoori Grill; Review: I travel through Marlborough once or twice a month and make it a point to ALWAYS eat here.  I love the flavors, decent variety at the buffet, and terrific service.  There seems to be some feedback regarding the pricing and I would say the lunch buffet is the best bargain.  I also love the dinner buffet and wish it was offered more nights a week!  Perhaps folks are mislead by the word ""buffet"" and think it should be a $5.95 all you can eat type of thing.  It isn't, it does cost more money, but I think it is well worth it.  Ordering off the menu is a bit pricey but, if you add some rice, a single order serves at least two people.  I've also ordered on line and the food was always ready at the time I requested, pipping hot.  I think this is a great place to eat and go there every time
Name: Lotus Blossom; Review: Update: 2/11/2018. Price for the buffet has increased to $23.50. Sadly, Daniel the bartender's salary has not. Still worth a visit or 12.  I stopped in here after passing for many months to and from work. I finally took a Sunday and went for the sushi buffet. It was fantastic. The selection was great and very delicious and fresh. The hot buffet was equally delicious. Choice of several stuffed dumplings, seasame chicken, noodles, white rice and some daily options. The decor is modern, with classic tables with cloth. I will definitely be stopping by again. FYI.. buffet is $17.50 I go just about every other Sunday for the last 4 years
Name: Abe & Louie's; Review: RUINED MY MOTHER'S DAY. VERY UNACCOMMODATING. GAVE NO NOTICE TO MODIFIED BRUNCH TIMES  I have been going to this restaurant for years, it has been a Mother's day tradition of ours.  This year I made brunch reservations well in advance but upon arrival I learned that the brunch times were shortened.  Our reservations were for 2:30 and brunch usually goes until 3.  I spoke to the manager and the server about how I had made reservations for brunch and really was not planning on eating dinner at 2:30.  I was dismissed even though I had specifically said that I was making reservations for brunch.  I had  2 family members included in our party who NEVER EVER come into the city and they specifically came in because I raved about the brunch... I was and still am very disappointed that I was not told ahead of time about the changed menu and more so I am unhappy by the way were were treated.  The waiter was annoyed because we took a while to order (dinner at 2:30).. I was hoping for at least an amazing entree.. just average.  I am very very disappointed.  Not going back anytime soon.  There are WAY better restaurants in and around the city.  Don't waste your money at this place","Name: Brownstone; Review: We had just arrived for a weekend in Boston and searched for ""Saturday brunch"" in the area of our hotel (park plaza).

Name: ELSA'S EATERY; Review: We had breakfast here today, trying out a new brunch thing they have going on Saturday and Sunday mornings.  It was mostly a single page menu for the brunch with 4-5 beverage (non-alcoholic) selections.  They also had 4-5 alcoholic selections available.  The portion size was HUGE, and I could only finish 1/2 of it, and it was super yummy.  Service was great, and the kitchen was speedy!  After discussing it for a while, we decided I got a Bertucci's vibe from them, if I had to compare it to a chain.

Name: Trophy Room; Review: Best South End Sunday Brunch in Boston Boston restaurants are numerous, on nearly every corner and intersection. In the South End, residents and visitors have copious choices, so we would like to point out a very pleasant experience we had this past weekend: Sunday brunch at The Trophy Room on Chandler Street (inside the Chandler Inn Hotel) at Berkeley Street. First impressions are important, and we received positive feedback as soon as we opened the door to the restaurant. The staff all greeted us so warmly that we couldn’t help but feel welcome! The host, with a big smile and a warm greeting offered us a window table, but we declined, preferring to sit at the 12-seat bar instead. The lounge has plenty of window tables, probably seating 40 or so. The comfortable-looking dining room is all banquettes, seating about 24. Fred, the bartender, smiled and immediately said “Hell-o” and when asked, recommended the very first item on the brunch menu: Eggs Caribe. The Eggs Caribe is a “Melt-In-Your-Mouth” delicious breakfast: grilled English muffin topped with lump crabmeat, poached eggs and topped with a chef-made creamy hollandaise sauce, served with leafy spinach and “breakfast potatoes”. These potatoes were not your usual home fries, but hot, crispy and yummy tidbits – and didn’t have that “Left-On-The-Grill-Forever” taste. The menu description for this dish did not do it justice - it was superb! We also highly recommend the steak and eggs dish: a 6-oz. portion of Boston strip steak cooked perfectly – moist, succulent and scrumptious. It comes complete with eggs and choice of toasted breads. Beverages are an important part of any Sunday brunch – and The Trophy Room didn’t disappoint here: the Berkeley Bellini had a nice twist, using grapefruit juice instead of the traditional OJ, with Mathilde Peche liqueur and sparkling Rose – luscious! The traditional Bloody Mary, made with bartender Patrick’s own recipe was not overly spicy, but delivered a nice kick – recommended. Coffee was hot, fresh and good – what else could you ask for, to start your day. The rest of the menu featured 6 breakfast dishes, 3 salads, 3 soups, 4 sandwiches and 5 luncheon items. We look forward to returning to The Trophy Room to investigate the rest of the Sunday brunch menu. For Sunday brunch in the South End of Boston, we give The Trophy Room 5 stars

Lots of flavor, cooked as ordered and juicy.   Would like to see the bottom bun less soggy, but it did not ruin it by any means.   Moderate pricing.

Gourmet burger food trucks,"Name: 5 Napkin Burger; Review: Disappointed all around.  The best part of the ""burger"" was the bun and the toppings.  I ordered online to pick up. The website told me estimated pick up time -  30 minutes.  I got there 30 minutes later to a near empty restaurant. Don't know what would take 30 minutes to make my fairly simple order of Bacon Cheddar Burger and cheese tots.  Well the order must have not taken 30 minutes and was sitting on the bar there for me when I got in there,and 2 minutes later when I got to my hotel room, the burger and the cheese tots were cold.  Burger was warm, the tots were legitimately COLD.  Other reviews say how huge the burgers are.  Mine was not so big.  It is not one of those big fat juicy burgers that is round and dripping with juice.  It was one of those flat thin burgers that reminded me of those frozen pre made burgers that were served from the food service, thrown on the grill frozen and just cooked from there.  The website allows you to choose your burger either medium or well-done.  I put in the notes on my order medium rare.  The burger was not hardly cooked.  It wasn't medium rare.  It was basically seared on both sides of the thin wimpy burger and then raw on the middle. The meat quality was poor since it was raw, I had to pick out all sorts of grisle and uncooked meat.  Then the Bacon Cheddar burger further disappointed.   There was no bacon on the burger. I think the cook was perhaps confounded by the infrequent ""medium-rare"" request and forgot about topping the Bacon Cheddar burger with bacon. To my dismay, the cold tots, numbered only 11 in a paper container that looked not so different from a fast food restaurant. With the paltry serving size, the cold 11 tots looked pathetic in the large container. The sesame brioche and toppings on the burger were satisfactory.  The raw white onion on top was nice flavor and mild, and sliced nice and thin.  The butter lettuce seemed fresh and clean.  The cheese was melted  and the bun toasted.  But boil it all down and you have a burger that is 3x the price of a fast food burger, that is not even as good as a fast food burger, and all for what?  Cause there is a burger fad that these guys had a vision to create the perfect burger?  I can see what they had envisioned, and perhaps another location of theirs has it mastered, but the location in Back Bay, Boston missed by a long shot.  Save your extra $10 and get a better fast food burger at any of the crappy little chains
Name: Cobblestone Café; Review: I thought this restaurant isn't everything people are screaming about,  the medium burger my son ordered was rare and he asked for no tomatoes. He said the flavor was good but only ate half the burger. (Because it was rare) if you claim to be the best burger in town (which most of boston does) than be the best burger in town! That means from the beginning to the end, get the order right, cook it right, and serve it right. My husband ordered a well cooked burger and it was pink! Good job guys. So not impressed and will not return nor will recommend
Name: Boston Burger Company; Review: This was my third time visiting a Boston Burger company and I am really sad about my experience yesterday.  I arrived around 6:45PM and the place wasn't very busy.  My friend and I sat down and ordered a beer, my beer was flat but I understand it happens sometimes so I didn't say anything.  I ordered the Kitchen Sink Burger priced at $15.50 cooked medium.  When it arrived it was cooked well done and didn't look like the colossal burger I remembered.  The burger resembled a typical fast food burger with a slim patty, and small fixings.  I was debating on whether or not to tell the waitress but I figured, there are only 5 people in the restaurant and if the kitchen is putting is out weak burgers without being busy it is better to not say anything.  I ate half my burger, told the waitress about the burger and told her not to worry.   I ordered a Freak Shake which was excellent but again very expensive.   After paying $50.00 for a burger, shake, beer, and tip I visited the bathroom which was filthy.  Paper towels were all over the floor, the toilet clogged, urine was on the floor, and the sink was a mess.  Again, only 5 people in the restaurant!   I really wanted to experience the Boston Burger Company I remembered but sadly it was a bad night
Name: Five Guys; Review: Went to order a quick burger 🍔, and there were not any lines to the cashier. Seems the online orders were working well since all the staff in the store seemed busy cooking and preparing food.  I got to order my burger with a double wooper with mayo, mushrooms with a slice of tomatoes. Yummy 😋!  After I finish paying for my order, it only took less than 10 minutes for my burger to be ready. While waiting, I got to see the chef make the burgers. They have an open kitchen where I got to see them fry the burger on the stove. The smell was so enticing, and it all felt natural since the burger was not precook and was still a reddish color before being cook.  After getting the burger, I ate it right there in the store. And since there were barely anyone in the store (mostly staff), I did not have to worry about any contamination with covid issues.  The burger tasted great, juicy and filling. Took me 3 to 4 minutes to finish and rush back to work
Name: Campus Trolley; Review: I loved this place for a quick lunch or dinner during a study break.  A lot of food for not much money.  Too bad they're not open longer hours.

From out of town and was looking for a place to get a fast sandwich for lunch. Saw there were trucks and fire department vehicles there and I knew I couldn't go wrong. Got a loaded cheese steak  (peppers onions mushrooms cheese ). Excellent taste but mostly meat - would have preferred more veggies. With soda was less than  $10

Name: LoLa Burger Boston; Review: Good Hamburger, crispy meat on the outside and juicy inside, a classic but tasteful bread, the cheese of your choice (My choice was Blue Cheese). Some purple onions, Tomato in a wheel with Gherkin and Lettuce. A classic but delicious hamburger. As is as one wants it.  I promise that in the next opportunity he took a picture of the Hamburger and published it.  La / Lo Burgue a restaurant where I can return to eat again.

Name: Crazy Good Kitchen (C.G.K ON NEWBURY); Review: Amazing burgers but mediocre chicken tenders. Recently dropped by to get chicken tenders, chili burger, and the double double trouble burger. Their patties, despite being cooked medium well done, were full of beefy flavors and it was truly one of the best I've tried in Boston. I opted for the double patty and it was difficult to bite through without getting messy, but it was absolutely worth it. Their chicken tenders, however, were more like dry rotisserie chicken. Pickles on the side definitely helped, but it wasn't exactly what I expected. Highly recommend trying their burgers though"
Vegan bakery options nearby,"Name: El Paso Enchiladas; Review: VEGAN OPTIONS GUYS in a sea of non-vegan restaurants. Such a sight for sore eyes when I saw these vegan empanadas. They are edible, not the best ones I've ever had but decent. Prices are fair. Staff is nice and friendly
Name: 5 North Square; Review: Wow, this might be the most disappointing experience I've had. First off, my girlfriend and are vegan and asked for the vegan menu, yet we were served butter. We specified we were both vegan, a little butter won't kill me, but  I'll pray for anyone with a nut or seafood allergy. We went for lunch and the vegan menu was meant for dinner (and extremely overpriced, considering the quality of our food).  The food was not terrible just extremely overpriced (we did send back the ""vegan"" dish that had butter, and they did replace it with a vegan one, and it's honestly worth wondering if they simply washed it off the butter and added garlic and oil)
Name: Flour Bakery; Review: Visiting Boston for the weekend and stumbled upon Flour Bakery. Giving us the local feel with the added customer service.  Refreshing to find a cafe with so many vegan options. I ordered a mouth watering vegan double chocolate muffin. The cashier suggested it be warned, she was not wrong! That thing was deliciousssssssss.  Be a little patient, it’s located in a high traffic intersection (hospital and hotels)
Name: Pressed; Review: Stopped in for a quick vegan bite and there were many options ready to grab and go. Recommend the vegan sushi, so good! Butternut squash was excellent too but wasn't sure if it was best cold or hot. There are many smoothie options too and I'll give them a try next time I'm on Charles Street. Very nice Urban decor
Name: Pescatore Restaurant; Review: Customer service was outstanding, I was there with two of my friends on a late night Friday. The food was very tasty and well made. The only reason I'm noy giving a 5 star rating it's because they lack knowledge and clear options on vegan dishes, I first introduced myself saying ""I'm vegan so I don't consume animals at all"" the lady offered me Fish then cheese, so it got me worried on how good they would care for my vegan entree","Name: Flour Bakery; Review: Visiting Boston for the weekend and stumbled upon Flour Bakery.

They also get you combo here which can be very economical. Something that's missing at their NYC locations. Vegan or not, one should definitely give this chain a try. If you come here once, you'll probably come here more. One can find it a bit pricey but it's worth it

Name: by CHLOE. - Boston Seaport; Review: It took me a while to figure out how I really felt about by CHLOE. Being a plant-based eater, I was so excited to try it the first time. I wasn’t blown away but I wasn’t disappointed either. I’ve since been back a handful of times to keep trying. Here are my thoughts:  The veggie burgers are average. Granted, it’s hard to get a good one but I had high hopes for a restaurant that’s selling point is vegan food.  The avocado toast is pretty good. I was really banking on that one and was pleased when I tried it. Great avocado go bread ratio and interesting selection of toppings.  Regular fries are alright. If you salt them, they’re much better. Sweet potato fries are excellent. Note: beet ketchup will probably throw you off at first. I’m a tomato ketchup lover so it doesn’t really do it for me.  Pancakes are great. I’ve had vegan pancakes elsewhere and these are some of the best. Great consistency and not overly sweet. The matcha and chocolate really make it.  I didn’t love the matcha blueberry muffin. It was dry and stuck to the paper. It also made a huge mess.  Chocolate ice cream is excellent.  I took a few bites of the gf chocolate cupcake and can tell you it’s mighty tasty. The frosting is nicely whipped.  My absolute favorite, however, would be the gf chocolate chip cookies. They’re the overall best cookies I’ve ever had in my life and I have had a lot of cookies.  I’ll continue to work my way through the menu. Again, I would not consider it the best vegan spot or even the best fast food style vegan eatery. But it’ll do

Gluten-free restaurant options,"Name: Davio's Northern Italian Steakhouse; Review: I frequent Davio's often for lunch, mostly because it has absolutely scrumptious gluten-free pizza (which is why it made my list of 11 Best Gluten-Free Restaurants in Boston). So when I heard they were adding an extensive gluten-free brunch menu, I jumped at the opportunity to try it out!  Davio's in Boston's Back Bay is a classy place, white tablecloths included. It's perfect for a fancy girl's brunch, a date, or to take your parents to when they're in town.  We started with the Caesar Salad, which was delicious and came with the most scrumptious parmesean crisps. I love how they were generous with the anchovies - for some reason a lot of restaurants skimp out on those, but their salty texture is so great paired with the romaine lettuce!  My sweet tooth was super excited about the gluten-free french toast and berry plate! Sometimes gluten-free bread can be crumbly or more crisp, but these pieces were soft and thicker - perfect for french toast!  N got the gnocchi with mushrooms and truffle oil. He likes the more earthy flavors so this one was a hit!  Prepare yourselves for the epic dessert tray that comes around as a brunch dessert!  At this point we were happily full, but who can say no to dessert, right? So clearly I opted for the flan and berry plate. No regrets! This dish was so decadent, and the vanilla flavor really stood out in the flan and paired nicely with the tart blackberries.  We experienced great service and impeccable meals during our brunch at Davio's - who has a full non-gluten-free menu as well. They have so many options on their menu, which means you can keep going back and getting something new every time. Plus, they're walking distance from the Public Garden, the South End, and shopping on Newbury Street or in the Prudential Mall! I definitely recommend a trip here whether you're gluten free or not
Name: Tavern in the Square Shrewsbury; Review: Not impressed. Like many have said, the food is overpriced for what it is, but that wasn't even the big issue. My mother has celiac disease and we have to be very careful about where we eat. She ordered gluten free Mac and cheese and the manager himself brought it over and it had a allergy flag in it.  Then a young woman brought some over after him, which looked totally different. We said we hope that it's not gluten free because she's already had been eating the one the manager brought over. The girl was immediately panicked and absolutely certain she had the gluten free Mac and cheese. While she was checking on it someone else brought over my not gluten free Mac and cheese and we knew by looking at it that the one my mother was eating was not the gluten free one. Small mistake maybe we could seriously land someone in the hospital. Allergies are a serious concern for some and the managers of all people should be aware of what they're bringing over to the table, especially since it looks completely different. That manager then went on to blame his expo mistake on the chef. The general manager came over to have us fill out an injury report to make sure their buts were covered. Do not go here if you have a real allergy
Name: Real Deal, LLC; Review: This place carries gluten-free options for sandwiches and pizza. This alone is noteworthy--It is really difficult to make gluten-free alternatives. Real Deal deserves kudos for incorporating these options on to their menu. However, after trying them three times now, I can say that they do not have the best gluten-free buns or pizza crust in town. The bun falls apart halfway through eating (I hate sloppy food so this annoys me). The pizza crust stays intact but needs to be cooked longer for my taste--It does not not have that charred look like the normal pizzas. It also comes in one size (and no single-slice option). 3 stars kind of feels harsh, because my fiancee (no allergy) loves Real Deal's regular menu. So, maybe it is 4 stars overall, but I'd say 3 stars specifically for their average tasting g-free options and blase customer service
Name: Banyan Bar + Refuge; Review: My boyfriend and I ate here for the first time today and we will never come back. If you have any type of food allergy, do not come here. The level of carelessness and how flippant the staff are to food allergies is unacceptable. The risk of health issues for just OK food isn't worth it.  My boyfriend is a celiac so we ordered only the items that were marked gluten free and he informed our waiter that he is a celiac when we ordered. Another server brought out our food and when he set the food down, I asked him if everything was gluten free and he confirmed that everything was. We noticed that the tuna poke dish that we ordered came on a bed of fried wontons which is not usually GF so we asked our original waiter to confirm whether the wonton chips in the poke was gluten free. He stated unequivocally that the food was gluten free and there was not even any cross contamination. After my boyfriend had already eaten multiple bites, the server came out and informed us that they had served us the wrong tuna poke dish and the one my boyfriend had already eaten was in fact not gluten free.  Given that the food was just average, we decided it wasn't worth the risk to keep eating here. There are so many great restaurants on Tremont so I'd recommend skipping this one
Name: Back Deck; Review: Back deck is literally in my backyard at work so coming here for one is very easy. The staff are nice, the patrons friendly and there is a gluten free menu with satisfying options. I've been here a lot and can not turn down the gluten free meatballs. Whether they have the lamb or turkey, it's a great bit to eat if your not all that hungry or as an appetizer to share. I often don't want to share but I will, no one has disliked them. People are always surprised gluten free food can be this good. They are made well, you can't tell the difference.  The burgers are great and frequently the reason I come here. I do not eat burgers often but when the craving hits, this is my go to option after work for a burger and french fries. Thats right, the french fries are gluten free and delicious so anyone can get them and one wouldn't notice. I like the atmosphere as well, it's an upscale laid back bar, clean and inviting environment.  Whether your looking for lunch, cocktails with appetizers or a burger this is the place to come. The bar is small so don't expect a club scene and the seating is what the name entails, like sitting on a back deck without the outdoor breeze. Without the splinters. Who can resist!!! During the summer they do open the large windows for the summer air, very nice.  This is one of the better restaurants in the area and one I personally prefer. The food is fresh, good selection and low key casual. Great place to hang out!","Name: Al Dente Ristorante; Review: First, I choose this restaurant because of the raving reviews of their attention to detail for people who are gluten free or have Celiac disease. I personally have Celiac disease, so finding an Italian restaurant that is authentic and understanding of cross contamination is super important to me.  I had the gluten free pasta and gluten free garlic bread. The garlic bread was not what you would imagine; it was more like a dense flat bread. It was worth the purchase though. I had the pasta dish at the top of the house specials page with veal, shrimp, and chicken in a garlic wine sauce. I thought it was rather tasteless and the gluten free pene was nothing better than I could've bought from any grocery store. Pretty disappointing for close to $30. Maybe it's because we came 30 minutes before the kitchen closed? But I felt that we were early enough to not be THAT customer.  Al Dente is my girlfriend and her family's favorite Italian restaurant. I had only been here once before about  year ago. I would try it again, but more because it's safe place I can find sustainance for myself and that it has awesome food for people without Celiac disease. I wouldn't return simply to enjoy their food on my own though.  Celiac friendly? Yes. Delicious? Meh. Go cook your own Udi's pasta and save $30

Name: Sultan's Kitchen; Review: They were absolutely lovely. I have gluten and dairy allergies so I have to be extremely careful going out to eat. He listened to my concerns, made appropriate substitutions from his huge knowledge of what is in each dish, and when one of the workers accidentally put cheese on my plate, he made me a new one with care and understanding. Not only was the food excellent, but it was my first time there and I will be back from how well I was treated by the staff. Going out to eat with severe allergies is stressful, but he eased my anxiety and I had 0 reactions. Highly recommend","Name: Al Dente Ristorante; Review: First, I choose this restaurant because of the raving reviews of their attention to detail for people who are gluten free or have Celiac disease. I personally have Celiac disease, so finding an Italian restaurant that is authentic and understanding of cross contamination is super important to me.  I had the gluten free pasta and gluten free garlic bread. The garlic bread was not what you would imagine; it was more like a dense flat bread. It was worth the purchase though. I had the pasta dish at the top of the house specials page with veal, shrimp, and chicken in a garlic wine sauce. I thought it was rather tasteless and the gluten free pene was nothing better than I could've bought from any grocery store. Pretty disappointing for close to $30. Maybe it's because we came 30 minutes before the kitchen closed? But I felt that we were early enough to not be THAT customer.  Al Dente is my girlfriend and her family's favorite Italian restaurant. I had only been here once before about  year ago. I would try it again, but more because it's safe place I can find sustainance for myself and that it has awesome food for people without Celiac disease. I wouldn't return simply to enjoy their food on my own though.  Celiac friendly? Yes. Delicious? Meh. Go cook your own Udi's pasta and save $30

Name: Real Deal, LLC; Review: This place carries gluten-free options for sandwiches and pizza. This alone is noteworthy--It is really difficult to make gluten-free alternatives. Real Deal deserves kudos for incorporating these options on to their menu. However, after trying them three times now, I can say that they do not have the best gluten-free buns or pizza crust in town. The bun falls apart halfway through eating (I hate sloppy food so this annoys me). The pizza crust stays intact but needs to be cooked longer for my taste--It does not not have that charred look like the normal pizzas. It also comes in one size (and no single-slice option). 3 stars kind of feels harsh, because my fiancee (no allergy) loves Real Deal's regular menu. So, maybe it is 4 stars overall, but I'd say 3 stars specifically for their average tasting g-free options and blase customer service

Name: Davio's Northern Italian Steakhouse; Review: I frequent Davio's often for lunch, mostly because it has absolutely scrumptious gluten-free pizza (which is why it made my list of 11 Best Gluten-Free Restaurants in Boston). So when I heard they were adding an extensive gluten-free brunch menu, I jumped at the opportunity to try it out!  Davio's in Boston's Back Bay is a classy place, white tablecloths included. It's perfect for a fancy girl's brunch, a date, or to take your parents to when they're in town.  We started with the Caesar Salad, which was delicious and came with the most scrumptious parmesean crisps. I love how they were generous with the anchovies - for some reason a lot of restaurants skimp out on those, but their salty texture is so great paired with the romaine lettuce!  My sweet tooth was super excited about the gluten-free french toast and berry plate! Sometimes gluten-free bread can be crumbly or more crisp, but these pieces were soft and thicker - perfect for french toast!  N got the gnocchi with mushrooms and truffle oil. He likes the more earthy flavors so this one was a hit!  Prepare yourselves for the epic dessert tray that comes around as a brunch dessert!  At this point we were happily full, but who can say no to dessert, right? So clearly I opted for the flan and berry plate. No regrets! This dish was so decadent, and the vanilla flavor really stood out in the flan and paired nicely with the tart blackberries.  We experienced great service and impeccable meals during our brunch at Davio's - who has a full non-gluten-free menu as well. They have so many options on their menu, which means you can keep going back and getting something new every time. Plus, they're walking distance from the Public Garden, the South End, and shopping on Newbury Street or in the Prudential Mall! I definitely recommend a trip here whether you're gluten free or not

Name: Banyan Bar + Refuge; Review: My boyfriend and I ate here for the first time today and we will never come back. If you have any type of food allergy, do not come here. The level of carelessness and how flippant the staff are to food allergies is unacceptable. The risk of health issues for just OK food isn't worth it.  My boyfriend is a celiac so we ordered only the items that were marked gluten free and he informed our waiter that he is a celiac when we ordered. Another server brought out our food and when he set the food down, I asked him if everything was gluten free and he confirmed that everything was. We noticed that the tuna poke dish that we ordered came on a bed of fried wontons which is not usually GF so we asked our original waiter to confirm whether the wonton chips in the poke was gluten free. He stated unequivocally that the food was gluten free and there was not even any cross contamination. After my boyfriend had already eaten multiple bites, the server came out and informed us that they had served us the wrong tuna poke dish and the one my boyfriend had already eaten was in fact not gluten free.  Given that the food was just average, we decided it wasn't worth the risk to keep eating here. There are so many great restaurants on Tremont so I'd recommend skipping this one

Recently, my husband has been diagnosed with Celiac disease, so he truly needs gluten free options. We went to Chill for dinner with friends this weekend and were pleasantly surprised with the gluten free options. Our waitress told us almost all menu options (with a couple of exceptions) can be made gluten free - even the burgers. The owners, John and Coleen, have decided to stock gluten free breads and sauces (no gluten in their soy), etc. and make sure they are cooked separately. If you are gluten free especially because of an allergy, this place is an absolute must!!  If you don't have dietary restrictions, I recommend anything on the menu. I specifically enjoy the steak and cheese egg rolls and the Chill chop salad with chicken salad on top

Name: All Star Pizza Bar; Review: Such a great find!! It was exactly what we were looking for. First- they have gluten free crusts and vegan cheese. Second - a super wide range of choices and toppings to choose from. A pie can be expensive ($31 for gluten free and vegan cheese) but it seems on par for Boston pricing. Super quick service and the AC is on full blast

Name: Giovanni's Roast Beef and Pizza; Review: Super disappointed in this location. As someone with celiac, finding a pizza shop in the Billerica area that serves any form of a gluten free sandwich or wrap and delivers is incredibly difficult.  I've ordered from Giovanni's twice in the last three weeks and each time they have not had gluten free wraps in stock. I called to cancel the second order today and they told me they do not have them because they have to purchase them. To top it they asked me if I ordered frequently enough for them to order wraps. I told them not to bother, because even if I did it's not reliable.  Please, do not advertise gluten free food as available on your site and not have it in stock. Regardless of whether people order frequently or not, if you advertise having it on your menu and available it should be in stock. There are plenty of non - gluten free items on the menu that I am sure are not ordered frequently that are available

Name: BOSTON KABOB COMPANY; Review: The food in this place is the best mediterranean food I had in Boston area, and is better than many places in Israel
Name: Dates and Olives; Review: It was my first Mediterranean food in Boston and my wife and I had a very pleasant experience out there. We ordered a chicken sandwich and brown rice bowl with three toppings. My wife pointed out the portion where they seem to be smaller than other Mediterranean restaurants but for me, the quality and freshness of the food were excellent that the portion fits perfect for me. When we visited the place around noon, it was very chill and quiet place to talk with my wife without disturbance. Highly recommend for local people or newcomers to Brookline/ Brighton area who wants to have healthy food with a quick bite. And last but least the Mango Lassi was the finale
Name: Tarboosh (Syrian shawarma & Manakish)شاورما عربي مناقيش مشاوي; Review: Reading five stars reviews made me excited to try this place. We ordered falafel, shawarma and kabab, all were disappointing. You can get better quality food in any American restaurant serve “fast Mediterranean food”. Usually, I am more generous with my rating but what made my experience even more unpleasant is the hygiene part. With hygiene I am not referring just to unclean table but referring to a a dog brought by one of the owner/manager and pet it in front the kitchen area! If you are looking for a quick bite close by it is your place but go with realistic expectation, if you are looking for authentic Mediterranean food this not your place
Name: Uptowne Mediterranean Restaurant; Review: I found out Uptowne Mediterranean Restaurant by accident. I was shopping in the plaza where it's located and it was lunch time so I wanted to give it a shot. They have great food for really great prices. The chicken and meat shawerma is as fresh as it can be. They cut it off the big rotating skewer and make your meal. The kebabs, appetizers, salads and fixing all are authentic Mediterranean recipes. Lots of Vegetarian choices as well. Falafel, Spinach pie etc. It's a family run business and everyone helping each other and the customers. I started also using them to cater for our company lunches. They make big platters also can make sandwiches. It's the best thing I discovered which reminds me of home. Thanks for your time reading this review","Name: Bishop's Mediterranean; Review: Ordered the sampler plate. Great portions, very flavorful food. I got it with the side of green beans. I thought it was gonna be just plain, but it was in a tasty, albeit very salty, tomato sauce. Def would come back, but maybe cut down on the salt. Unless it's supposed to be that salty
Name: Zest Mediterranean Grille; Review: I’m very glad I found this place on boylston st,Very delicious Mediterranean food it reminds me of back home, the price was very cheap for quantity and quality of the food excellent  service and staff was very friendly they even welcomed me with a free falafel dipped in hummus to try tasted very good.would recommend this restaurant because I’ll definitely be back for more
Name: Zest Mediterranean Grille; Review: Super fresh food, expertly made, in short. I had the  Falafel Plate that comes with three sides. Everything was top-notch. the falafel balls seemed like they just came out of the fryer...still warm and steaming inside. Often at many places these are dry inside. These were moist with a slightly crunch outside, with a delicious flavor, made even more so by the spicy tahini sauce I picked. I had three sides out of what looks like 12 or so choices; a great selection. Everything looked great but I wanted to compare to other places so chose the tabbouleh salad and the fattoush salads, as well as the moussaka. Everything was very fresh with high-quality ingredients IMO. The tabbouleh was delicious, well-balanced and bright with the right amount of lemon juice. The fattoush was delicious and refreshing; I really enjoyed the small amount of mint in it. Finally, the moussaka is something I had not had before. It was delicious with its chick peas and stewed eggplant and tomatoes.  I really appreciate a place like this in general, but especially when traveling when it seems so hard to get fresh, healthy food. This place is a gem. The food and environment is kid-friendly and I can't wait to bring my family back here. Zest, please keep on doing what you are doing!

Name: Archie's Place; Review: One of the only places in the area to actually get a breakfast with bacon and eggs or French toast.   I love to get the steak tips with rice pilaf and mashed potatoes for lunch. I’m not big on all the Mediterranean stuff that seems to be popping up in the area so Archie’s is one of my go to’s for lunch.  Friendly staff also

Name: Derne Street Deli; Review: I've been going here for the past 5 years. This is your casual sit in or take out spot. The staff is very friendly and humble. They have a Mediterranean fusion going on. and their portion sizes are pretty big. I'm always really full after I'm finished with my dish. A few of the dishes I tried:  -a Greek style falafel sandwich with tzaziki sauce (very tasty with fresh pita) -chicken salad sandwich (they don't skimp out on the chicken) - Cheeseburger and fries (delicious) -Veggie Omelette with Cheese (pepper, onion, mushrooms absolutely YES! I'm an omelette freak) - Pizza (go for the Greek pizza with olives and feta) - egg, cheese, and turkey on a bagel (breakfast to GO) -Chocolate Chip cookies (baked fresh every day) :)  They're exactly the type of small family owned business you'd want to keep going to

Name: Falafel King - Summer Street; Review: Awesome place for a Mediterranean food lover They have falafel and salads as well I am a vegetarian so this place works out pretty well for me The portions are pretty good as well Make sure you are clear with what you want while you are explaining to the server because they don’t seem to be very fluent with English (which is fine bdw) Also do keep in mind they don’t have a very large seating arrangement so grab and go will be a better option if you are thinking of visiting this plac"
I want really good French wine,"Name: Bar Lyon; Review: We were really excited to try this current hotspot in Boston, however, although we don’t consider ourselves picky French Americans, in the end we were disappointed.  I ordered the French onion soup as an appetizer, which had no broth, it was just onions. The taste was good but a bit overwhelming without broth. The chicken and burger were delicious. However the steak which we ordered well done was almost charcoal. Finally the nice bottle of red wine we ordered was freezing, right out of the fridge. I’m sorry, but any French person would be appalled at serving a chilled bottle of red wine.  Despite this, the waiter was very nice. Unfortunately I do not recommend this restaurant
Name: Ma Maison; Review: I have never eaten french food before, this is my first time. So I can't really compare or say if it's really authentic french food. I also come from Italy so I know the value and taste of good food from europe. I can say this was one of my best food experiences in Boston. I liked every dish I tried, like the escargots, coq au vin, crepes, fois gras and the creme brulee as the dessert. Everything was very testy, delicate and also nice to look at. I had some sauvignon blanc in carafe as wine and it also was very good. I liked that they bring you the baguette bread as much as you ask and it comes warm as freshly baked with some butter. The dishes have a lot of sauces, especially the escargots, so it is a shame to waste all that goodness without doing ""scarpetta"" with the bread. The waiters also were very nice and always ready to help us.  Overall I had a very good experience, I liked the food and I felt good during my stay there. Good job to everyone, I will definitely come again to try more french cuisine!! :
Name: Bar Lyon; Review: Overall this restaurant had outstanding French comfort food.I had the burger which was probably one of the best burgers I've had in the last 5 years I normally don't get a burger for dinner but I figured I'd give it a shot and it was boy it was good! Prices were not really cheap it was a moderately priced restaurant. Definitely was hopping when we were there.we plan to go there again soon not sure exactly what I mean it's a fair distance from where we live but it's worth the drive. If you do like true French cuisine I would highly recommend the cassoulet. Overall there's nothing on the restaurant menu that I actually could not recommend. We're big when it comes to French food and I would say everything on there was a winner
Name: Grand Tour; Review: We were excited to try this new place but it was unfortunately very disappointing. I’m French and have lived most of my life in France and the food at Grand Tour is not even close to French food sadly... First, it is incredibly overpriced. To give a few examples, the Jambon de Paris was 3-4 slices of thin ham (not Parisian ham at all by the way) at $10. The cheese plate was a selection of 3 New England cheeses (not even French ones) and the 3 pieces were paper thin at $24. We also had the Foie Gras which was tasteless at $22. Tip is also included at 20% for a party of any size (we were just 2 people) which we thought was unusual for Boston. The service was good though. Overall, not a French experience at all. Just a pretentious overpriced restaurant...it was deeply disappointing
Name: Nusr-Et Boston; Review: Horrible experience.  The atmosphere was eerie, food was not impressive and I still am feeling violated from that night.  My significant other and I asked for a red wine and acknowledged that we did not know very much about wine.  We stated that we like Pino Noir but other than that genre, we did not know much more about red wines.  The Somalia ended up bringing three options, one which my significant other chose off of the label picture and the Somalia responded “that’s an excellent choice.”  The wine was good but tasted like any red wine that we’ve had.  The bill came later and we saw that the wine cost $790.  We left the restaurant dumbfounded.  I would never ever spend that much on a bottle of wine.  Ever. I feel like we were played and I feel violated and am infuriated.  I spoke with the general manager the following day, who basically confirmed the price of the wine and said that the prices were on the website and on the menu which is hard to look at on one’s phone.  I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone","Name: Frenchie Wine Bistro; Review: To kick off our dinner, we shared some « escargots », some « coq au vin », and what I consider to be the best Tuna Tartare in town. Everything was so good that we asked for extra bread to finish all the sauce, but please don’t repeat that... But it wasn’t until the traditional « steak frites » cooked medium rare and the home made french fries, which is such a typical french meal, and which was soooo good, that I trully felt like in one of the best French brasserie in Paris. And I’m not done yet... I won’t even get started with the wine and cheese list, because I could write 2000 words only about it and how I almost had tears of joy because of it, but I’d say this: The olive oil cake we had as a dessert is simply the best dessert I had in a very long time, and makes it worth it by itself to put Frenchie on top of your to-dos when you come to Boston. LOVED IT
Name: Bar Lyon; Review: Boston *should* have a Lyonnaise bouchon and I want to give you lots of my business and become a regular if not for the wine program.... (high marks for the cuisine!).  The white wine list is very good. The Red, however, is unacceptably expensive and the selection doesn't match the Lyonnaise spirit....  Advice from someone who is a connoisseur of Beaujolais and Lyonnaise cooking:  1.PLEASE put more GOOD Beaujolais on the list (no Georges du Boeuf) 2. For both the red and white list, put a really EXCELLENT but inexpensive Beaujolais AOP and a Beauolais Blanc on the list for $8 or $9/glass. Offer them also by the bottle and the carafe at reasonable prices. Lapierre's Raisin Gaulois fits the price point for a Beaujolais rouge, as does Jean Marc Burgaud's Beaujolais Villages. And Chateau de Lavernette makes an excellent Beaujolais Blanc as does Jean-Paul Brun.  At this point, Ma Maison is still my go-to French bistro because of the excellent yet affordable wine list they offer, in addition to the superb food.  The bouchon does not aspire to haute cuisine or its prices... I'd love for you to be a place a where I can take friends to hang out and drink good French wine and eat, all for a good price....*just as I can in Lyon*  Please don't do to the bouchon what Boston has done to ruin Tapas.  I hope you'll embrace the feedback from someone who is a would-be passionate supporter and customer and wants to see you succeed
Name: Fromage Wine Bar and Restaurant; Review: I wanted to come here for a while now, but I knew - it's not a casual place to grab a bite. My boyfriend took me for a wonderful date - and it was above all my expectations. It's not big, therefore not loud and very cozy. Their selection of wine is huge. They offered a ""wine trial"" - a selection of 4 different wines (of your choice - either red, white or rose) - was perfect for me 'cos I'm not good with fine wines. We also chose a 5 cheese plate - delicious! That's why we went there - for a fine wine and cheese. Wonderful experience! I would recommend a little thing though - if there will be a tiny notes about wines&cheese names and origins, that would make the experience even more exquisite. And also, a little honey would go so good with a cheese plate. And the wine trial glasses were huge - not that I complain about that 😁, I liked them all, and just drank them all. But those were not a trial size, I'm just sayin
Name: 1855 Wine Bar Restaurant; Review: I came in as part of a group - an ecelectic mix of Canadians, Americans and a German -- and asked the waiter to make decisions about the wine and food for us. This was not a mistake! We had a spectacular wine experience. Started out with crème de cassis, followed by a great light red Bourgogne, and ended with a fuller (but not heavy) Bordeaux. These accompanied perfectly in timing with the small, flavourful tapas plates brought out over the course of our conversation. It was exactly what you would hope from a place like this, lovely food, excellent wine and a stimulating evening of conversation. 1855 has created a wonderful atmosphere and I recommend it to anyone

They offered a ""wine trial"" - a selection of 4 different wines (of your choice - either red, white or rose) - was perfect for me 'cos I'm not good with fine wines. We also chose a 5 cheese plate - delicious! That's why we went there - for a fine wine and cheese. Wonderful experience! I would recommend a little thing though - if there will be a tiny notes about wines&cheese names and origins, that would make the experience even more exquisite. And also, a little honey would go so good with a cheese plate. And the wine trial glasses were huge - not that I complain about that 😁, I liked them all, and just drank them all. But those were not a trial size, I'm just sayin

Name: 1855 Wine Bar Restaurant; Review: I came in as part of a group - an ecelectic mix of Canadians, Americans and a German -- and asked the waiter to make decisions about the wine and food for us. This was not a mistake! We had a spectacular wine experience. Started out with crème de cassis, followed by a great light red Bourgogne, and ended with a fuller (but not heavy) Bordeaux. These accompanied perfectly in timing with the small, flavourful tapas plates brought out over the course of our conversation. It was exactly what you would hope from a place like this, lovely food, excellent wine and a stimulating evening of conversation. 1855 has created a wonderful atmosphere and I recommend it to anyone

Name: Sel de la Terre; Review: Excellent ambiance.  Wine selection is fantastic.  Great venue for business meetings as well as a romantic evening with your significant other.  Highly recommend raw oysters, scallops, charcutterie and steak","Name: Bar Lyon; Review: Boston *should* have a Lyonnaise bouchon and I want to give you lots of my business and become a regular if not for the wine program.... (high marks for the cuisine!).  The white wine list is very good. The Red, however, is unacceptably expensive and the selection doesn't match the Lyonnaise spirit....  Advice from someone who is a connoisseur of Beaujolais and Lyonnaise cooking:  1.PLEASE put more GOOD Beaujolais on the list (no Georges du Boeuf) 2. For both the red and white list, put a really EXCELLENT but inexpensive Beaujolais AOP and a Beauolais Blanc on the list for $8 or $9/glass. Offer them also by the bottle and the carafe at reasonable prices. Lapierre's Raisin Gaulois fits the price point for a Beaujolais rouge, as does Jean Marc Burgaud's Beaujolais Villages. And Chateau de Lavernette makes an excellent Beaujolais Blanc as does Jean-Paul Brun.  At this point, Ma Maison is still my go-to French bistro because of the excellent yet affordable wine list they offer, in addition to the superb food.  The bouchon does not aspire to haute cuisine or its prices... I'd love for you to be a place a where I can take friends to hang out and drink good French wine and eat, all for a good price....*just as I can in Lyon*  Please don't do to the bouchon what Boston has done to ruin Tapas.  I hope you'll embrace the feedback from someone who is a would-be passionate supporter and customer and wants to see you succeed

Name: Frenchie Wine Bistro; Review: To kick off our dinner, we shared some « escargots », some « coq au vin », and what I consider to be the best Tuna Tartare in town. Everything was so good that we asked for extra bread to finish all the sauce, but please don’t repeat that... But it wasn’t until the traditional « steak frites » cooked medium rare and the home made french fries, which is such a typical french meal, and which was soooo good, that I trully felt like in one of the best French brasserie in Paris. And I’m not done yet... I won’t even get started with the wine and cheese list, because I could write 2000 words only about it and how I almost had tears of joy because of it, but I’d say this: The olive oil cake we had as a dessert is simply the best dessert I had in a very long time, and makes it worth it by itself to put Frenchie on top of your to-dos when you come to Boston. LOVED IT

Name: The Melting Pot; Review: Comfy place and nice cheese fondue (different from the one we have in France though, go to the Wine Cellar for authentic taste)! However, we got charge for more than what the website's promotion was advertising, which was an unpleasant surprise

Name: Ma Maison; Review: I have never eaten french food before, this is my first time. So I can't really compare or say if it's really authentic french food. I also come from Italy so I know the value and taste of good food from europe. I can say this was one of my best food experiences in Boston. I liked every dish I tried, like the escargots, coq au vin, crepes, fois gras and the creme brulee as the dessert. Everything was very testy, delicate and also nice to look at. I had some sauvignon blanc in carafe as wine and it also was very good. I liked that they bring you the baguette bread as much as you ask and it comes warm as freshly baked with some butter. The dishes have a lot of sauces, especially the escargots, so it is a shame to waste all that goodness without doing ""scarpetta"" with the bread. The waiters also were very nice and always ready to help us.  Overall I had a very good experience, I liked the food and I felt good during my stay there. Good job to everyone, I will definitely come again to try more french cuisine!! :

Name: Ocean Prime; Review: Took my girlfriend to have dinner there yesterday night. Some things were amazing, some others were not. The place is great, really gorgeous and comfortable. I don't judge Menu prices because it is what it is, you pay more to have more quality.  So to start off, pretzel as a distraction is a great idea. They were pretty good. So was the bread.  Our waiter was certainly efficient and polite, he certainly knew what he was doing. But he lacks an essential thing, which is to smile while you are providing your service. A normal questions such as "" - Do you want to order an entree or just stay with the appetizers?"" or specific questions once you open the wine bottle should sound normal in such restaurant but coming from his mouth they were just judgy. I felt like I was being tested. I didn't feel home. At the end, my girlfriend and I were wishing we had been served by the Brazilian girl that eventually stopped by to make sure we had enough water in our glasses. She had the right attitude, the welcoming attitude.  We ordered Pelegrino for water (glass bottle, a must for carbonated drinks, well done). For appetizers we ordered : Steak tartare (delicious, could certainly spot the Dijon Moustard) and White truffle caviar deviled eggs (Good, but not impressive, its lacking something). For entrees we ordered: Sea scallops (Good, although Parmesan couldnt be tasted in the rice. It tasted like some kind of nut) and Teriyaki Salmon (Comes assembled in your plate looking like a giant sashimi, food was well prepared, the Japanese bean sprouts didnt have the same consistency of the rest of the food). For wine we ordered Gilles Morat, Pouilly-Fuissé, “Terriors de Vergisson,” Burgundy, France, 2014. (Very good, certainly it was stored correctly and at the right temperature).  For desserts, guess what? Nothing. Why?  Too much food before. Everyone should be able to have a 3 course meal, wasn't possible there. I normally eat very well ( a bit more than most people), but didn't have the courage to order a dessert.  Very nice touch to have a selection of Digestifs in the desert Menu!  So after all this being said, I dont think that I would go back there"
Cafes with delicious coffee,"Name: Eagle Hill Cafe; Review: Delicious! love the flavor coffee especially the pumpkin spice very refreshing ice coffee very rare I would ask for a black coffee with so much flavou
Name: Boston King Coffee; Review: I love this place! The food is always fresh and delicious. But, I really come for the espresso and the iced coffee. Each drink is hand-made by Peter, a coffee wizard. You won’t have to order here long before they know your coffee by heart. Plus, it’s such a quiet and comfortable place, you can really enjoy your beverage in peace. Ask Peter about the coffee and he can tell you things like how they drink it in Italy or Paris, and where the beans come from. This is a daily stop for me now. It’s worth going out of your way to get some Boston King Coffee
Name: Banh Mi Ok; Review: Popped in for a Vietnamese iced coffee and turned out they were closing for the day. They gave me an order of spring rolls on the house. They were delicious. Coffee was delicious. Will certainly go again.  Update: went again a month later, this time earlier, specifically to get a sandwich. It was excellent!  As were the egg rolls and shrimp spring rolls.  Coffee was still delicious
Name: Dunkin; Review: Yesterday was National Coffee Day and I stopped by this location for a breakfast sandwich and free coffee as advertised. I ordered a sandwich, donut and the free medium coffee. The manager took my order and charged me full price for the coffee. When I reminded her of the promotion which was stated on the illuminated wall sign behind her, she glared at me and said that the deal was, ""Buy one coffee at full price and get a second one free"". I corrected her and showed her the promotion on my phone as well, ""Free medium coffee with ANY purchase (including food)"". She snapped at me then kept repeating, ""Buy one coffee, get one free"" in a robotic voice. ""Do you want a free coffee or not?"" I told her I was purchasing other items and I expected the free coffee as it was advertised EVERYWHERE. At that point she just glared at me and remained silent. I told her to cancel the order and that I would go to the Boylston street location instead. I had no problem getting my free coffee at Boylston. Later I called Dunkin customer service and the representative was shocked at the manager's behavior and confirmed that she was wrong. She offered me another free coffee with her apology. I will never visit this location again

Name: Cafenation; Review: This is one of those hidden Brighton gems. The coffee is always great, and they've got a rotating selection of drinks if you're looking for something different.  Seating isn't very comfortable. If you're hoping to settle in and get work done, the back of the cafe has a calmer vibe with a great ""get stuff done"" soundtrack. The front is good for a quick meeting or if you're banging out emails before catching the bus.  It's slightly pricier than other coffee shops, but the coffee is better. The menu is stocked with comfort food. If you're gluten free you'll have a rough time, otherwise it's a great place to fuel up.  Overall a great little cafe with great drinks, staff who enjoy their job, and a cozy ""Brighton"" vibe
Name: Cafenation; Review: A local watering hole! This cafe has great coffee, breakfast pastries, and a menu of sandwiches/salads. With a collection of small tables in the front and larger community-type tables in the back. The staff is friendly, progressive, and professional.

It's great for something fast and simple, but it's nothing out of the ordinary.  Simply a solid A-OK.  Their drinks are hit-or-miss for me.  I tried their hot chocolate, which was more like luke-warm chocolate.  Almost cold, unfortunately.  Tasted watered down instead of the thick, silky, chocolaty taste you look for in hot chocolate.  Their hot apple cider was better.  It was actually hot, as advertised.  The cashier didn't know what I meant when I said I wanted a hot apple cider, but it was one of their prominent specials.  Only a brief moment of confusion, it must have been a very new item.  But it was flavorful, hot, and tangy.  The interior isn't as cozy as a lot of other cafes in the immediate area.  Feels a bit cheaper.  There were napkins strewn around the floor, crumbs and stickiness on many of the tables, and the chairs looked a bit dirty.  It may sound odd, but the lighting was also a problem.  For all the booths along the window-wall, there is this bright-as-the-sun ceiling light blinding anyone who sits facing it.  In fact, the entire store was very bright.  That's suitable for a lunch takeout place, but a cafe should be darker.  Their sandwiches are prepackaged, and on the expensive side.  I'd hope for something freshly made if I'm paying full price for it.  It's a generally OK cafe.  Decent drinks, decent sandwiches, decent environment.  If they cleaned up more frequently, and turned the lights down, it would make it much more inviting

Name: Thinking Cup; Review: Where to start with my favorite cafe(s) in Boston? Every spot I have stopped by has been extremely busy, so this is not your quiet little cafe scene. They have a simple but unique coffee and espresso menu. Personally, my favorite has been their cinnamon honey latte. I just can't get enough! Plus every order has had beautiful latte art, really showing off their creative skills.  On the food side they offer pastries along with other sandwiches and salads. I had their bacon, egg and cheese on an English muffin today. Well let's just say not a crumb survived. I have also been eyeing a pasta salad that I will probably get for lunch this week.  Their service is top notch too. They are quick but courteous at the front registers. The order is normally processed in under a few minutes and they get your name right. The whole place is kept clean, with plenty of indoor and outdoor seating.  Really you should stop by and check it out if your looking for a nice cafe experience in Back Bay

Name: The Burger Bar and A Little Bit More; Review: Food and service were both great. Prices are extremely affordable - lunch for 2 with iced coffees came to $18. Waitress was very nice and our food came out very quickly. Will definitely be back again

Name: The Kitchen Café; Review: This is a wonderful spot for breakfast and lunch. I have been coming here a while, since I work around the corner, and they know my name and that I’m vegetarian. All the people are lovely and I’ve never had a bad experience.  They’re breakfast sandwiches are 10/10, they even have a veggie version. Breakfast stops around 10:45. There are lots of lovely lunch options, and a featured board that changes daily. They have kombucha on tap! I haven’t had their coffee but they have oat milk, so that’s cool. Right now they have a matcha turmeric and honey drink that looks yummy. I love seeing cafes creating fun features drinks.  Also the space is beautiful. Lots of table space, and a bar by the window, and warm lighting. I always recommend The Kitchen Cafe to people looking for food in the area! Thanks

Name: Cranberry Cafe; Review: Completely underrated lunch spot in Southie. Their sandwiches are made fresh to order and are delicious. They have a great selection of iced coffees with daily flavorings available. Very small spot, but great for a quick lunch or for take-out"
Where can I get the best espresso martinis?,"Name: Cafe Vanille; Review: I got the chocolatine and a double espresso. Chocolatine was just eh but the espresso was good
Name: Pavement Coffeehouse; Review: I am bewildered how this has such a high rating.  It certainly can not be for either their drip coffee or espresso.  I ordered a small coffee to go and an extra short restretto espresso for there.  I received what looked like almost 3/4 of the small espresso cup full, definitely not short.  I sat down and realized there was dirty coffee crust on part of the rim of the cup... Gross.  So how was the espresso, it seemed like over roasted coffee beans rather than arabica espresso.   It had a slight acidic taste and we'll since it was pulled improperly it was diluted and a very small crema.  Without question if this was served in Italy the shop would be empty within a month and out of business.   You can get a better espresso from a kiosk at the airport, and that's not something you would do twice.  The coffee was an equal disappointment.   It was very very acidic almost to point of sour.  After a short walk I realized my coffee was simply undrinkable triggering the sour receptor glands.   I tossed 3/4 of the cup where it belonged, a Boston street garbage can.  What a waste of $6.00.  I can't imagine that anyone with a sense of taste for quality coffee would rate this anything other than a one star.  I suppose if you drown the coffee with syrups and heavy cream the sweet and sour mixture may be palatable.  Either that or the attraction is a millennial thing
Name: Ristorante Villa Francesca; Review: The food was fine.   Everything else wasn't.  We arrived 15 minutes prior to our reservation and went to the bar for drinks.  It took the bartender almost twenty minutes to put together our drink order -- a glass of wine, a margarita on the rocks and two espresso martinis.  She started with the martinis....10 minutes later, she served them, but with orange vodka instead of vanilla.  It took another five minutes for her to find a lime and open the bottle of tequila.  The last drink served was the simplest --  pouring a glass of wine.  Despite having a reservation,  we ended up at a table in the basement next to a work station, where they kept dumping dirty plates with great zeal into a rubber bin, in clear site, as loudly as possible.  3 of our 4 dinner orders were plated and sitting on the counter two feet from us for almost ten minutes as they waited for the fourth plate.  Not a good system. Definitely not worth the  $250 tab for food and drinks.  Too many options in the North End to consider going back
Name: Tuscan Kitchen; Review: All that can be said is, WOW. This place is truly top notch. We have been back six times over the past few months and never had anything less than a 5 star experience.  Let’s start with the atmosphere couldn’t be more beautiful! The location and panoramic windows really make you appreciate the heart of Boston.  The drink and wine lists are amazing, so many options and the servers are always extremely knowledgeable and happy to give a recommendation or two! My personal favorite is their espresso martinis, not creamy and the high quality espresso is unlike any I’ve had elsewhere!  As far as entrees are concerned my favorite is Roasted Butternut Squash Cappellacci. My husband is a huge fan of the Tagliatelle al Tartufo. All the details of this restaurant are what makes it, even the bread is my favorite anywhere!!  Zappolis and a coffee are the best way to end dinner (in my sweet tooth’s opinion anyways).  Great with events and allergies. We’ve never had a single issue here and the manager Charles is always visible which my husband (who is a manager) himself believes is what makes everything run as fantastic as it is. Safe to say we are officially loyal to Tuscan Seaport
Name: Alcove; Review: Pretty disappointed. Came with 3 friends one of which lives at lovejoy above the restaurant. 3 different waiters came over to us and took our drinks 3 times. My drink was missing then when i got it the waitress said she didn’t have enough so she left for 20 minutes before filling up my glass. We ordered and didn’t see our waitress until well after our food came. When we were done she asked if we were getting dessert, we said no we are okay for now we will order more drinks in a little bit. We weren’t over our time at all at this point. She leaves for 30 minutes, avoids us, drops the check and tells us our 90 min is up. We say we never got to order our espresso martinis and were never given a heads up that our 90 minutes was ending, nor were we told we only had 90 minutes from the start. The manager comes over and tells us we’re over our 90 minutes and we have to leave. We order the martinis to go, which takes another 25 minutes. Then another person comes over and tells us we’re over our wait and have to leave... we tell her we’re waiting for our to go drinks... where is the communication in this restaurant? Seems silly we couldn’t have ordered while sitting there or gotten any help from the manager in this situation with the server avoiding us all night. We left very disappointed and it was handled so unprofessionally","Name: Explorateur Cafe, Restaurant & Bar; Review: I was at Exploratuer last Saturday with my wife before a Christmas party. We both had cocktails,  she an Espresso Martini and I had an L Street Informant. Both cocktails were spot on and delicious.  Fast forward to this past Thursday, I went back in for a beer before an event I had to go to. The bar tender remembered me  and the cocktail that I had and asked if I wanted another. Pretty impressive for such a busy place.  The guys were slammed on Thursday afternoon. They were spot on making detailed drinks flawlessly.  Most impressive is the quality of the bartenders and second to that is quality of the ingredients.  My go to place for a good beer or outstanding drink when I'm in the area.  The cafe offers great pastries to bring home. Never been let down. The kids who work there seem like Political Science majors; but with $12.00 bucks an hour coming their way - nothing can stop them now.  Check this place out
Name: Dolce Vita Ristorante; Review: I have been a customer of Dolce Vita a few times now and I make it a point to enjoy a meal and drink here whenever I spend time in the North End. I made a reservation for my friends and I to partake in drinking some delicious martinis before a 10pm show. When we arrived at our reservation, we were seated and greeted. We noted to the waiter (who also happened to be the restaurants owner) that we were here just for drinks and dessert. Immediately after stating that, we felt an uncomfortable vibe and an unwelcome atmosphere. We proceeded to order espresso martinis, which typically in the north end are staples. All seven of our espresso martinis were wildly inconsistent. Some of ours tasted as if the bartender forgot to add any ingredient besides the vodka, others were so diluted with that it tasted like I just consumed four shots of straight espresso, while others were a watery cold brew tasting mess. I gave it another go and ordered another martini in hopes that the bartender was just overwhelmed before and that’s why they arrived terrible last round. I received my second and it was just the same- $15 for straight espresso in a fancy glass. At this point, 8 shots of straight espresso later and a riddled mess from all the caffeine consumption, I requested our check so we could make it to our show. When we put down our card and cash, we heard the owner say to the staff to “make sure to take a picture of the card”. We all looked around in disbelief and asked in if indeed he did state to take a picture of our credit card. He giggled and said “it is for tax purposes..” I have never heard of that before, and some of us felt I comfortable with that idea, so we put as much cash down as we could to avoid multiple cards being potentially scammed. To top the night off, the receipt for the card arrived back with $100 more than it should have been charged. We politely waved him down and he said “oh yea I charged you wrong-I just realized now..” Moral of the story- check your receipts at Dolce Vita, don’t waste $120 on the worst espresso martinis in Boston, and don’t go for only drinks and dessert unless you would like to be treated like a waste of their time. I have never been so disappointed in a restaurant experience, and I sincerely hope they do better

Name: Pavement Coffeehouse; Review: Worst place for coffee and super expensive. I have to admit, I am not a coffee connoisseur but this coffee is by far one of the worst I have had. I got an Iced Americano and it was way too watered down. They only add two shots of espresso! And if you saw their definition of two shots you would say it was more like one or half a shot. In fact, my buddy ordered a double espresso and when he got it he was confused and asked the barista if they forgot the second shot. On top of that, it was ridiculously expensive. The Americano cost $3.50 when at Starbucks you get a medium Iced Americano for $2.55 and they make it with 3 shots of espresso. While the Americano at Starbucks has a deep brown, almost black color to it, the Americano I received from Pavement was just a dull brown.  With that said, I am not a Starbucks advocate what so ever, or even a coffee enthusiast, but I do enjoy a nice Americano and this place just didn't do it for me
Name: Eastern Standard; Review: If I ever get pregnant, I'm going become a regular at ES, so I can sit at a classy bar with a delicious drink in my hand and still feel like a real person. The drink menu has a section of mocktails that sound almost as fun as the real thing. Almost. But since I'm not even close to being preggers, I obviously didn't go for those.  Went on a Saturday night during a Sox game so that there was a slight lull in patrons. Grabbed two prime seats at the bar where we could see all the action. The atmosphere is chic and lively. The kind of place where you can stay for a good few hours and make a night of it. Which is exactly what we did.  When it comes to cocktails, it's all about the progression. As a dark and stormy lover, I started out with a Patriot Sling since it features rum and ginger beer but also kicks it up a notch with the citrusy tones of lemon and the slight sweetness of honey. Ahoy, matey. Next up was the Metamorphosis, which my drinking companion informed me was always a crowd pleaser. This also rocks lemon and honey, but the Czech liquor adds a unique, herby element. I can see why the crowds are pleased. The last drink I got was the Ponce de Leon, which I don't even think is listed on the menu. A strong, rum-based drink, it rocks hints of orange and vanilla and happiness.  These aren't the kinds of drinks you guzzle down. We were seated at this bar for nearly 4 hours, taking our sweet time and enjoying the atmosphere. However, the crowd radically changed once the Sox game ended. It was interesting the hear patrons, now crowding around us trying to get the busy bartenders' attentions, ordering standard beers and screwdrivers. Why don't you go over to Lansdowne instead? The noise level also increased a few decibels, and combined with the music, we found ourselves nearly shouting at some points.  Did I mention that these drinks are strong? I won't have been able to gracefully leave my chair   if I don't get some food in my system stat, so we look over the menu and decide to split some Steak Tartare. After we order, the bartender places white napkins on the bar in front of us and puts down a plate of two little buns of deliciously chewy, sea salt-sprinkled bread with some whipped butter. This service is super impressive, considering how busy they are, how long we've been occupying these bar seats, and how little food we've ordered. The steak tartare is brought out with crispy sliced baguette as well as thin fries. The portion is great for two to share, and the flavor and texture of the meat is divine. Salty, fresh perfection, the tartare is the ideal alcohol-absorbing accompaniment.  At $10-12 per cocktail, the prices are reasonable considering the restaurant's location and atmosphere as well as the quality of offerings and service. Sit at the bar. Get some food. It won't be a cheap night, but it will definitely be an enjoyable one.

He giggled and said “it is for tax purposes..” I have never heard of that before, and some of us felt I comfortable with that idea, so we put as much cash down as we could to avoid multiple cards being potentially scammed. To top the night off, the receipt for the card arrived back with $100 more than it should have been charged. We politely waved him down and he said “oh yea I charged you wrong-I just realized now..” Moral of the story- check your receipts at Dolce Vita, don’t waste $120 on the worst espresso martinis in Boston, and don’t go for only drinks and dessert unless you would like to be treated like a waste of their time. I have never been so disappointed in a restaurant experience, and I sincerely hope they do better

Name: Boston King Coffee; Review: I love this place! The food is always fresh and delicious. But, I really come for the espresso and the iced coffee. Each drink is hand-made by Peter, a coffee wizard. You won’t have to order here long before they know your coffee by heart. Plus, it’s such a quiet and comfortable place, you can really enjoy your beverage in peace. Ask Peter about the coffee and he can tell you things like how they drink it in Italy or Paris, and where the beans come from. This is a daily stop for me now. It’s worth going out of your way to get some Boston King Coffee

Name: Pavement Coffeehouse; Review: Worst place for coffee and super expensive. I have to admit, I am not a coffee connoisseur but this coffee is by far one of the worst I have had. I got an Iced Americano and it was way too watered down. They only add two shots of espresso! And if you saw their definition of two shots you would say it was more like one or half a shot. In fact, my buddy ordered a double espresso and when he got it he was confused and asked the barista if they forgot the second shot. On top of that, it was ridiculously expensive. The Americano cost $3.50 when at Starbucks you get a medium Iced Americano for $2.55 and they make it with 3 shots of espresso. While the Americano at Starbucks has a deep brown, almost black color to it, the Americano I received from Pavement was just a dull brown.  With that said, I am not a Starbucks advocate what so ever, or even a coffee enthusiast, but I do enjoy a nice Americano and this place just didn't do it for me

Name: Pavement Coffeehouse; Review: I am bewildered how this has such a high rating.  It certainly can not be for either their drip coffee or espresso.  I ordered a small coffee to go and an extra short restretto espresso for there.  I received what looked like almost 3/4 of the small espresso cup full, definitely not short.  I sat down and realized there was dirty coffee crust on part of the rim of the cup... Gross.  So how was the espresso, it seemed like over roasted coffee beans rather than arabica espresso.   It had a slight acidic taste and we'll since it was pulled improperly it was diluted and a very small crema.  Without question if this was served in Italy the shop would be empty within a month and out of business.   You can get a better espresso from a kiosk at the airport, and that's not something you would do twice.  The coffee was an equal disappointment.   It was very very acidic almost to point of sour.  After a short walk I realized my coffee was simply undrinkable triggering the sour receptor glands.   I tossed 3/4 of the cup where it belonged, a Boston street garbage can.  What a waste of $6.00.  I can't imagine that anyone with a sense of taste for quality coffee would rate this anything other than a one star.  I suppose if you drown the coffee with syrups and heavy cream the sweet and sour mixture may be palatable.  Either that or the attraction is a millennial thing","Name: Dolce Vita Ristorante; Review: I have been a customer of Dolce Vita a few times now and I make it a point to enjoy a meal and drink here whenever I spend time in the North End. I made a reservation for my friends and I to partake in drinking some delicious martinis before a 10pm show. When we arrived at our reservation, we were seated and greeted. We noted to the waiter (who also happened to be the restaurants owner) that we were here just for drinks and dessert. Immediately after stating that, we felt an uncomfortable vibe and an unwelcome atmosphere. We proceeded to order espresso martinis, which typically in the north end are staples. All seven of our espresso martinis were wildly inconsistent. Some of ours tasted as if the bartender forgot to add any ingredient besides the vodka, others were so diluted with that it tasted like I just consumed four shots of straight espresso, while others were a watery cold brew tasting mess. I gave it another go and ordered another martini in hopes that the bartender was just overwhelmed before and that’s why they arrived terrible last round. I received my second and it was just the same- $15 for straight espresso in a fancy glass. At this point, 8 shots of straight espresso later and a riddled mess from all the caffeine consumption, I requested our check so we could make it to our show. When we put down our card and cash, we heard the owner say to the staff to “make sure to take a picture of the card”. We all looked around in disbelief and asked in if indeed he did state to take a picture of our credit card. He giggled and said “it is for tax purposes..” I have never heard of that before, and some of us felt I comfortable with that idea, so we put as much cash down as we could to avoid multiple cards being potentially scammed.

Name: Ostra; Review: Fine Dining with Excellent service! My wife and I finally got a night out. The kids went to the sitter, let's go splurge. Ostra a top hit on a Google search for best seafood in Boston. Let's do it. Food was excellent with tons of fancy artistic looking dishes. Large selection of wines. Fancy cocktails like the ""oyster martini"". Honestly this is not usual thing for us. We had a tough with the menu. We didn't  know what half the stuff on there was. One of the many staff members came over, spelled it all out for us. We decided to order a bunch of random things. They suggest splitting dishes. Again we both got a smaller portion of one. Enjoyed everything we had. Hight reccommend the ""lobster gnocchi""! Oysters are top notch from different regions. I don't think I could've ordered anything I would've enjoyed. The chefs make everything work and taste awesome. Also kudos to the staff. I can't say enough on how good they treated us and made sure we had an excellent night out. 5

Name: 7 Nana Japanese Steakhouse; Review: I do not recommend going to this place if you are looking for quality 🤢. The service was ok at best and definitely not worth the price for hibachi. For the first time ever at a hibachi place the food was flavorless. We ordered espresso martinis and while I couldn’t stomach more than a sip of mine, my mom drank some of hers before we realized they looked curdled. We told the manager - more so just to let them know than anything, I wasn’t expecting money back as one drink was half gone. The manager grabbed the bottle and tried to have my mom smell it! Like literally shoved it in her face which I feel like is really inappropriate and unsanitary. After she refused to smell it she said “I was a bartender for several years i can see there is something wrong with this” all he did was LEGIT shrug his shoulders and walk away. My mom has been sick since we left 🤮🤢. Not a good experience

Name: Alcove; Review: Pretty disappointed. Came with 3 friends one of which lives at lovejoy above the restaurant. 3 different waiters came over to us and took our drinks 3 times. My drink was missing then when i got it the waitress said she didn’t have enough so she left for 20 minutes before filling up my glass. We ordered and didn’t see our waitress until well after our food came. When we were done she asked if we were getting dessert, we said no we are okay for now we will order more drinks in a little bit. We weren’t over our time at all at this point. She leaves for 30 minutes, avoids us, drops the check and tells us our 90 min is up. We say we never got to order our espresso martinis and were never given a heads up that our 90 minutes was ending, nor were we told we only had 90 minutes from the start. The manager comes over and tells us we’re over our 90 minutes and we have to leave. We order the martinis to go, which takes another 25 minutes. Then another person comes over and tells us we’re over our wait and have to leave... we tell her we’re waiting for our to go drinks... where is the communication in this restaurant? Seems silly we couldn’t have ordered while sitting there or gotten any help from the manager in this situation with the server avoiding us all night. We left very disappointed and it was handled so unprofessionally"
Are there pet friendly restaurants in the area?,"Name: Tarboosh (Syrian shawarma & Manakish)شاورما عربي مناقيش مشاوي; Review: Reading five stars reviews made me excited to try this place. We ordered falafel, shawarma and kabab, all were disappointing. You can get better quality food in any American restaurant serve “fast Mediterranean food”. Usually, I am more generous with my rating but what made my experience even more unpleasant is the hygiene part. With hygiene I am not referring just to unclean table but referring to a a dog brought by one of the owner/manager and pet it in front the kitchen area! If you are looking for a quick bite close by it is your place but go with realistic expectation, if you are looking for authentic Mediterranean food this not your place
Name: Tipico Dominicano; Review: Great place, the food was amazing and they are very friendly
Name: The Algonquin Club; Review: It was an interesting step back in time in the back Bay area. Really enjoyed my short time in the area
Name: Guira y Tambora; Review: I was with a friend who is Hispanic when he took me to this restraint (without telling me where we were going).  We parked on the main road right out in front on Washington Street.  As we approached the restaurant, I started to notice how large of a place it was, it is much larger than almost every other in the area and it is much fancier than any other in the vicinity.  When we opened the door and entered, I couldn't believe how beautiful the dining area was considering its location (because most restaurants in the area are not fancy places and are usually small corner places).  When I received my plate, I was even more stunned but its presentation..  I was amazed at how well they have perfected the entire experience.  I would recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting or living in the area and even anyone who is willing to travel for a delicious meal and a great experience.  5 stars all day every day!!!  Thanks Guira Y Tambora!!
Name: Coda; Review: I work in the Pru and was meeting a friend for lunch. I wanted a small, local business and thus got good reviews.  Went just after opening on weekday and got a window seat on a nice sunny day. Lots of tables and seats at bar for a small space. The brick interior matches the Back Bay architecture outside the window.  Up front, I have to comment on the bathrooms. Very clean, very spacious. Most small spots squeeze the bathroom in and, when you are 6'3"", it matters. Plus they are unisex so no waiting for one while other is open. Seems very LGBT friendly, now that I think about it.  We were greeted warmly and mentioned we had heard good things on Yelp - I expected them to bristles at that word but, it was cool. No alcohol was consumed so, I cannot comment there but the bottle of still water brought to table reminded me of Europe.  My burger was excellent; cooked perfect medium and the bun was gloriously buttery and sturdy. Buns that melt are a pet peeve. Fries were good too - thin and crisp. My friend got a fried chicken sandwich. She didn't realize it came w cheese but she scraped it off. They offered another but she declined.  The service was prompt and friendly. We were left to our conversation as the place filled up for lunch. I will definitely return with others and tell coworkers about it. I like to support local businesses when they make an effort towards excellence","Name: Piccolo Nido; Review: Friends called this restaurant in the North End to request seating for some of the Boston Marathon medical volunteers/ first responders, the Comfort Dog Handlers and the dogs themselves. Once the restaurant manager heard me say 'service dogs', he refused to make the reservation, saying ""No, we can not do that"". I reminded him that these were, in fact, service dogs and that it is the law to allow service dogs into public places. His response...""So, sue me."" I hope everyone who reads this and understands the roles that service dogs provide, for all people, will read this and never frequent this restaurant. This is disgraceful, on so many levels
Name: Taproom Bar & Grill; Review: Really fun spot, close to our house.  There is a cute patio outside with several tables gorgeous hanging baskets and music. Some nights they have live music, and the interior of the bar is really nice. There is a dining area and they have these really unique doors that roll up and open up to make it an open air bar. A few dogs even visited and were enthusiastically loved upon by several patrons. Cozy and hip at the same time
Name: Little Asia Restaurant; Review: Best Chinese food in the area.  The owners, Michael and Tammy along with their team are very friendly and efficient.  All their dishes are fresh and delicious.  A true neighborhood restaurant with a full bar and Keno, if you’re so inclined.  Almost has that Cheers vibe, “where everyone knows your name”.  A hidden gem.  Stop in to eat or order takeout.  They also deliver
Name: Dog House; Review: Yo my dog went missing did it end up on the menu
Name: Petros Pizzeria & Grill; Review: To be honest, you don't expect to find this type of service & quality too often from a  ""Sub / Pizza Shop"" in Massachusetts. You definitely get huge portions of delicious food at very reasonable prices. So far, everything I've tried was worth it. The Buffalo Chicken Fingers (more like forearms, size-wise) are tender, moist & flavorful. I've found my cheat-day burger joint as well! Plus, the people working there seem truly happy to serve you. Win/Win - Don't miss out","Name: Taproom Bar & Grill; Review: Really fun spot, close to our house.  There is a cute patio outside with several tables gorgeous hanging baskets and music.

Name: Little Asia Restaurant; Review: The place is great for a family or if you just need a quick bite and a beer. Their food is always a top go to but a secret weapon of theirs is the chinese pizza. I'm not sure it's on their online menu but just ask, they're awesome. The staff has always been very friendly, they get to know you quick and treat you like you've been going forever. Now with Covid they have barriers between tables and seem to be taking the situation seriously. They have a bar area and a variety of drinks (man's mai tai is always my go to), keno if you want to kill time while waiting. Would definitely suggest trying if you haven'

Name: Yellow Door Taqueria; Review: At first you may walk right by Lion's Tail. It's lack of signage and unassuming facade are part of the charm. Once you enter you're greeted by friendly hosts. The restaurant is split into two sections. A long bar area with plenty of room to stand behind it, clearly meant for busy Friday and Saturday nights. The second is a relatively small seating area for dinner service.  The restaurant specializes in cocktails and the size of their drink menu reflects that. There is something for everyone on. Many of the drinks feature some type of fruit or fruit infusion. My table ordered an Apple Toddy and a Lion's Tail (a bourbon drink). We were both pleased with our drinks, but not blown away.  For food we ordered the burger (medium-rare), the rock candy braised pork belly, and the fried chicken thigh sliders. The staff was very accommodating about having the burger cut in half for sharing.  First the burger came out cooked exactly how we asked, which was great. The patty was nice and juicy and the potato bun was excellent. The real star was the horseradish mustard. Really made the burger. The fries that came with the burger were very crispy and well seasoned. Overall an excellent dish and one of the better burgers in the South End.  The pork belly was a bit disappointing. The meat itself, while tender, was a little dry and under seasoned. The habanero barely came through and the waffle lacked crispness. However the pears were very good. I'd probably skip this dish.  The chicken sliders, while not quite as good as the burger, were very good. The fried chicken was crispy yet still moist. The pineapple slaw added a nice flavor and the BBQ sauce was finger-licking good. Another recommend dish.  Overall the Lion's Tail is a nice addition to the South End. It's casual, reasonably priced,  has tasty food and an extensive drink menu. A great place to catch up with friends, I'll be paying Lion's Tail another visit soon

Name: The Barking Crab; Review: 7/20/19 The hottest day so far this summer 94* ATMOSPHERE- place was packed. An out door dock side tent with picnic table seating & out side table & chairs to accommodate small parties & patron's with canine companions. The music is loud & hanging in the tent is a sign that states"" Don't ask us to turn down the music; this isn't your office, it's a bar! If you need quiet go back to your board room/ cubicle"" It was loud& festive. Lots of laughter & talking over eachother. SERVICE- Great. We were seated & a pail of water was immediately placed under our table for our canine companion. Our waiter was friendly & new the menu well. He was present, made himself available even though they were packed & he was obviously busy. We didn't have to wait or ask for anything, refills were brought to our table before we asked. Since we were drinking Non- alcoholic bevys it was great. <Remember the temp! 94* thick, heavy, humid.> Slight refreshing breeze off the water, made eating outside comfortable. FOOD-  was fresh & delish. Mussels, lump crab salad & lobster rolls. All delish. Portion size ridiculously minimal for non-appetizer's COST- Reasonable for area $$$  DISLIKES -#1. The women's restroom is dark, small is understating the cubic ft. 2 stalls, small sink, [pet peeve; no hand drying materials.] A line into hallway most  of the time. Suggestions for outside eating area not under tent, industrial fans for thick humid days","Name: Pete's Dockside; Review: We stayed at the waterfront area for PAX weekend.  This was my second year going to PAX.  Similar to what I noticed last year, the options for food were not as great by the waterfront as it is in the center of the city.  A quick google search showed us Pete's Dockside rated high, two dollar signs, and walking distance from the Westin hotel (about a 11 minute walk).  At first, from the outside, the place is hard to notice as it is conjoined with a truck warehouse.  But inside is a small  order and sit area, which seats about 15 people.  Based on description, they've been serving fried seafood for years.  I ordered the Seafood Combo, which was a platter of the seasons fried seafood.  My order came with fried haddock, shrimp, and scallops.  The seafood tasted as fresh as implied in the ""dockside"" of the location's name  We also ordered the soup of the day, Fish Chowder.  I had never had fish chowder before, and was a little skeptic, but the fish chowder was just as good or better than any clam chowder I have had to date

Name: wagamama seaport; Review: I visited Wagamama in the South Boston waterfront this evening.  It is a nice idea, well carried out. Large clean well lighted space (they did dim around 730)  and sharp pretty wood everywhere. Lovely setting. Servers are locals, and are energized nice people. Highly likeable.  It is priced quite low for the glittering area. Low low low. A very short walk from Ocean Prime and Mortons Steakhouse.  The food, from so-so to better than so-so. So-so is really good at their prices, in this location.  I paid $7 for vegetable tempura appetizer. Enough for a light lunch. very nice dish. nice sauce in a dish, some seaweed scattered about. Fun and interesting. Above so-so.  I had the pad Thai with Udon noodles. Seems sized for the doggie box crowd. Not really sparkling. Nice comfort food.  We had two rounds  of drinks and tipped heavily and got out for $40 a piece.  I give 4 stars because I do not see anything ""fine"" on the menu. 4 stars is very good for what they are trying to do.  Almost nowhere else on the South Boston waterfront to eat at a normal person price.  I do wish they offered sushi and rolls and all that, which they do not, but that is OK

Name: El jardín Restaurant & Bakery; Review: Very disappointed in the food we were served, I came from Chicago IL to visit Boston and I would think the east coast would of had more authentic Colombian food. We ordered “hot dogs” which consist of a hot dog, crumbled up potato chips and the special sauce, sometimes bacon. Instead we received a hot dog smothered in cold slaw and no crumbled up potato chips and some stale cheese on top. We paid 82.00 for 5 very terrible hot dogs and 3 drinks. I do not recommend by any means. Had to stop on our drive back to Braintree because my stomach could no longer tolerate it.  I am very disappointed with the food we received, I came from Chicago IL to visit Boston. I thought that the food around here would be more authentic than what I have over there. I was wrong. We ordered hot dogs which are hot dogs with red sauce and fries for ensima. What I received was something out of this world. Hot dogs with coleslaw salad, with a more horrible cheese and without the sauce. We paid 82.00 for 5 horrible dogs and 3 sodas. I do not recommend this place at all. I had to go to the bathroom on the road to the house, my stomach could not tolerate that food.

Name: Elephant & Castle; Review: Hit-or-miss bar I went to a few times because it was right next to my hotel. They have a large selection of beers and liquors, and the people behind the bar are generally nice, but the food and table service were underwhelming. There were a couple servers that just seemed like they were in a foul mood or were just bad at serving. The chicken strips were boring and obviously out of a bag while the panko crusted hot dog was just a massive miss for me (it looked like it was supposed to be eaten like a hot dog or wrap, but I was unable to eat it without fork & knife, way too awkward). The servings were large and could easily feed two people which sucked for someone going back to a hotel room with no fridge. I felt the price was a little more than what was delivered

Name: Real Deal, LLC; Review: Covid helpful info: parallel street parking, no meters. Most times of the day you can find a spot near this location. Once you walk into the joint you will go to the cashier to get your food. They have 2-3 tables inside but not sure if you can dine in there. No tables to dine out, it is mostly a location people do take out or delivery from.  This location is a local favorite for me. I used to live near the Cleveland Circle location, hang out with friends near the JP one, and now I live by the West Roxbury location and I love them all equally. Their food is consistent and they are always quick. My favorite app that I get almost every time is their onion rings because they are really yummy but I am a big fan of sauces and their kickin bayou sauce is delicious! The sauce is like a sriracha, Mayo, and other yummy things (real deal sorry if I’m wrong with those ingredients!) Meals I typically get are the Joe Spa (chicken Caesar wrap), Reuben, grown up grilled cheese, any burger, and any pizza. Definitely would recommend going to any of their locations"
I want authentic Japanese soba,"Name: wagamama; Review: A great place to stop by for lunch or dinner inside the mall. There is plenty of seating available inside and outside (inside the mall). We opted for a booth table.  The staff tended to us right away. We ordered the Korean BBQ beef Bao and crispy cauliflower for appetizers. They were both tasty but the meat was a bit on the dry side. Really enjoyed the cauliflower and would love to to lessen how to make it. It was crisp but not oily, with the proper mix of spicy and sweetness.  For the main dish we ordered the ryokucha soba which is served with two miso glazed cod fish. The fish was just lovely and tasted so soft and buttery. The soba was flavorful and prepared right. It was a bit on the salty side and would have liked it a bit less salty.  The other entree was the short rib beef ramen. The beef was so tender and tasty, you could easily make it fall apart with a fork!! The ramen was perfect and we really enjoyed it. If it wasn't for the dry Korean beef and the salty soba, I would have given it a solid 4 stars...  There was also a change of staff in middle of our dinner which made it for a bit of wait and no server checking up on the food..
Name: Tora Japanese Restaurant; Review: I get cravings for good Japanese or Japanese-esque food when I am traveling. While I was in Boston, I looked for a good Japanese type restaurant, and this one seemed the most interesting to me. I as started to walk towards the location of the restaurant, I realized I was walking into China town. So, my hopes of this spot being authentic was pretty much gone, but that was ok.  The restaurant is a few steps down from the street. The space is not too big, but enough amount of seating. A staff came to me as soon as I entered, and directed me to one of the bar seat since I was alone. He was very nice and polite. He also explained the menu for me since I have never been there before.  For drink, I ordered Iced Yuzu Tea, sweet and ice cold, perfect on a hot day! For the food, I wanted their Kaisen Don. I didn’t find the perfect bowl with the sashimi I wanted. So, I ended up with Sake Ikura Don with Tuna added on. The food came out super fast! It was quite nice, good portion, it certainly hit the spot.  The staffs were all non-Japanese, but they were very polite and helpful. I felt welcomed and it was good, relaxing lunch. Again, the price point could get high based on what you want, but the sashimi was fresh and pretty good portion

Name: wagamama; Review: I would first like to say that I came in with an open mind already knowing that it wasn't going to be a five star meal. So if you think I'm being too harsh please know that I had a horrible experience here. I ordered the soba noodles with chicken and shrimp and it's was below basic. First off, those are NOT soba noodles, secondly it was bland, the texture seemed like it was burnt in some areas and mushy in other parts. I checked In and got the one free side with a main and got the fried pork gyoza, horrible. The filling was bland, soft, and just plain inedible. Not only were the gyoza bad but The service was even worst.  He seemed annoyed with us and never came to check up on our table. It literally took 6-10 mins to get a glass of water or tea. I also ordered a ramen but never received it. The server apparently didn't know even though I repeated my order three times. On top of that he charged me for the gyoza that was suppose to be free n I had to go back and tell him. I will never return
Name: Angora Cafe; Review: The food here is excellent. There's a real emphasis on healthy food using good ingredients.

Name: Nobo Japanese Restaurant; Review: Our party of three had a very enjoyable dinner feast yesterday. As it was my wife's b-day, we over-ordered to sample about 7 dishes and an extra bento box with chicken and cucumber maki. The atmosphere is contemporary, clean and comfortable. My starter - the seafood soup - was the only menu item I did not care for...but this may be my preference rather than an issue with the dish. The assortment of fish, scallops, shrimp and veggies was too 'fishy' flavored for my liking, much like lake fish. The waiter was great about it and replaced it with their miso soup, which was fine. All the appetizers were terrific, and the crab rangoons (I know, more Chinese than Japanese, but still a favorite) among the best ever.  My favorite dish, hands-down, was the peppered salted pork. It was fried with a crisp coating (I think tempura-style) and the inside was juicy and flavorful. The portion was generous. We also ordered 3 sushi dishes that were very beautifully presented, but somewhat average in taste. Nonetheless the sushi was still enjoyable. Nobo is pricey and not a place we'd frequent every day. But I believe you get what you pay for, and we would certainly go there for future celebrations

Name: Oisa Ramen; Review: Wow. I’m a huge ramen fan and Oisa is some of the most sophisticated noodles I’ve have the pleasure of slurping. The broth is clearly the star of the show at this hole in the wall boutique - it is so delicate and complex without lacking flavor. The broth is paired with straight noodles, which are mild and reflect off the broth’s profile very well. You almost feel clean after having eaten here, if that makes any sense. The bowl of noodles is a beautifully orchestrated homage to its ingredients. The toppings are delicious; I never thought the thin slices of pork or the pickled greens atop the noodles could possess such decadent flavors - how sorely I was mistaken! Oisa is worth the visit! My only concern is that the broth is so good, I wish there was more to go around! Guess I will have to return soon","Name: Tora Japanese Restaurant; Review: I get cravings for good Japanese or Japanese-esque food when I am traveling. While I was in Boston, I looked for a good Japanese type restaurant, and this one seemed the most interesting to me. I as started to walk towards the location of the restaurant, I realized I was walking into China town. So, my hopes of this spot being authentic was pretty much gone, but that was ok.  The restaurant is a few steps down from the street. The space is not too big, but enough amount of seating. A staff came to me as soon as I entered, and directed me to one of the bar seat since I was alone. He was very nice and polite. He also explained the menu for me since I have never been there before.  For drink, I ordered Iced Yuzu Tea, sweet and ice cold, perfect on a hot day! For the food, I wanted their Kaisen Don. I didn’t find the perfect bowl with the sashimi I wanted. So, I ended up with Sake Ikura Don with Tuna added on. The food came out super fast! It was quite nice, good portion, it certainly hit the spot.  The staffs were all non-Japanese, but they were very polite and helpful. I felt welcomed and it was good, relaxing lunch. Again, the price point could get high based on what you want, but the sashimi was fresh and pretty good portion

Name: Shin Hakata Ramen; Review: Very Delicious Ramen ( I tried the Unagi Ramen) along with thr Takoyaki, had one small piece if squid in it but it was okay. The atmosphere was very Authentic giving off that Japanese/Anime ish vibe. Had hand sanitizer pumps at every table, wrapped Silverware So thats neat.  Would definitely recommen

Name: Nobo Japanese Restaurant; Review: Our party of three had a very enjoyable dinner feast yesterday. As it was my wife's b-day, we over-ordered to sample about 7 dishes and an extra bento box with chicken and cucumber maki. The atmosphere is contemporary, clean and comfortable. My starter - the seafood soup - was the only menu item I did not care for...but this may be my preference rather than an issue with the dish. The assortment of fish, scallops, shrimp and veggies was too 'fishy' flavored for my liking, much like lake fish. The waiter was great about it and replaced it with their miso soup, which was fine. All the appetizers were terrific, and the crab rangoons (I know, more Chinese than Japanese, but still a favorite) among the best ever.  My favorite dish, hands-down, was the peppered salted pork. It was fried with a crisp coating (I think tempura-style) and the inside was juicy and flavorful. The portion was generous. We also ordered 3 sushi dishes that were very beautifully presented, but somewhat average in taste. Nonetheless the sushi was still enjoyable. Nobo is pricey and not a place we'd frequent every day. But I believe you get what you pay for, and we would certainly go there for future celebrations

Name: sushi time; Review: I had a very sad experience at this place. My mouth was watering for a Japanese ramen so I decided to try this one. The price is ok and the staff is also fine but I was very disappointed with the food itself. Unfortunately, it seemed like my plate was one those options you buy at the grocery store and just add water.. The instant noodles type.. I also ordered it with some meat toppings that didn't look very appetizing, to be very honest. I try avoiding writing bad reviews but I would just like to give other people a heads up, as I don't wish them to leave the restaurant disappointed the way I did","Name: Kappo Sushi and Ramen; Review: Tried their sushi burrito. Very fresh ingredients with salmon, tuna, tobiko eggs, and a mixed slaw that all worked very well together. Miso soup was delicious as well! Will be back to try out their ramen. Side note: this place is being run by the same people behind Ebi Sushi (Union Sq) and Hokkaido Ramen (Central Sq), so you can have high expectations for food quality

Name: wagamama seaport; Review: I would give this place a solid ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Nothing was out of this world mindblowingly amazing (Then again...do you EVER get that experience at a chain establishment??) but everything was solid and left me wanting more...maybe because I was really hungry  I ordered the large Positive juice (16oz) for $6 which is most likely comparable to getting juice elsewhere...it has pineapple, spinach, lime, cucumber and apple which had a good taste but was DEFINITELY a little too sweet for my liking  The Yasai Yaki Soba was priced at $10...not a huge American sized portion but big enough, I’m not complaining...I was really hungry so I scarfed it down and was hankering for seconds The taste was good, not mind blowing...it could have used a tad more ginger along with a little more vegetables overall imo but the noodles were solid!  Anywho...for a chain, this place is good and I would totally eat here again for sure   8/1

Restaurants with plant-based foods,"Name: Thai Basil; Review: Great food, they have a super decent amount of vegan option! From appetizers, to soup, to drinks, to main meals, their curry is also FABULOUS! I always get the vegan mango curry! Everything I have tried here has been so delicious, to be honest. They always make the proper accommodations when I tell them I am plant based, and Alex (the owner and manager, plus his wife) are super super nice and down to Earth! I have become a regular and this is a fan favorite for my guests whenever I get take out! Highly recommend
Name: Sweet Caroline's; Review: I've been here a few times for drinks and light appetizers. I really like the space, cool plant wall, high ceiling, exposed brick and wood. But they don't seem to have found their niche yet. It's trying to be a nicer space but can't quite capture that clientele. I think they need a better cocktail menu and some more interesting foods. It is a great addition to the Fenway 'sports' bars but I wish they would re-image as a nicer drink and food place similar to Citizen's but maybe not as high brow as that; definitely with some fried pickles
Name: Burtons Grill & Bar of Shrewsbury; Review: Wow. The appetizers are the same price as the entrees. Had lunch with my parents and ended up with $70!! Ordered burger, was normal, $16.00 plus $2 for bacon. Chili's bar and grill makes the same burger. Nothing interesting about the meat. Normal chicken sandwich you would find at Panera, $16!!! Note: it isn't fully organic. Only thing was good, lemonade and not bad price. It looks nice but its too expensive for this area and the food is no different from chain restaurants. In fact, there are more burger choices at Red Robin. I think because they write on the menu that they get local grown food, they automatically jack up the price 40%. Just wait for the Whole Foods Market to open and eat there. Amazon bought Whole Foods and has cut their prices over 50%.  OUT OF ALL THE HUNDREDS OF RESTAURANTS IN THE AREA. Don't go here. Save your money
Name: Roasted Peppers Pizza; Review: I have ordered from here multiple times but today the food took over an hour to arrive at my house. The foods worth the wait but the delivery time is inconsistent
Name: Moko Japanese Cuisine; Review: My family and I had such a good time..ambient surrounding and a nice long list of foods. I think combing different foods here was a very good idea. Tuna and crab are outstanding and sushi that is fine..Fresh and Delicious. I could have stayed longer however..I should have :)  I will recommend this restaurant too anyone seeking some time off and enjoying a nice wine and  great Japanese Cuisine.  F. Lambert, Boston, Massachusett","Name: by CHLOE. - Back Bay; Review: Very spacious and the theme they have of the place is really nice. The food is outstanding. Avocado Toast or Burger or Soup or Air Baked Fries, it's just amazing. They are a Healthy Fast Food restaurant, hence I did not have to worry too much about the kind of bread they'd use. Great motivation for me to stay Vegan :D. The Beet Ketchup and Chipotle Aioli they have is out of this world. Would come over and over. They have really amazing dessert choices in Vegan. Cupcakes to Pancakes to Pastries. They also get you combo here which can be very economical. Something that's missing at their NYC locations. Vegan or not, one should definitely give this chain a try. If you come here once, you'll probably come here more. One can find it a bit pricey but it's worth it
Name: MC Kitchen; Review: Amazing vegan cuisine! I ordered the Raw Beet ravioli made with almond ricotta. It was incredible! The ricotta was flavorful and refreshing. I also tried their especial which was the Spicy Chipotle and Cashew Mac and Cheese. It was also amazing! I always measure the quality of a vegan restaurant by it’s mac and cheese and this place really proved that vegan mac and cheese can be wonderful. The prices are reasonable given the excellent quality of food here
Name: MC Kitchen; Review: Amazingly tasty vegan food with locally sourced ingredients. Presentation is great and the price makes sense too. Have been here twice, liked it a lot both times. Time Out Market Boston is better than its original in Lissabon, there are many other vegan options under the same roof. The bar offers various local ciders too

Name: Globe Bar & Cafe; Review: A large group of coworkers and I visited the restaurant on what I can only guess was a moderately busy Wednesday night.  I initially informed the waitress of my vegan preference and got great answers about several of the promising menu items (none of which turned  out to be vegan). No offer or attempt was made to approach the chef to  see if an exception could be made to accomodate my preferences.  After ordering a salad and specifying that I wouldn't like any animal products on it including dairy, honey and eggs, I was served a salad consisting of mostly greens, raw broccoli and croutons containing butter and a non-vegan Caesar dressing on the side.  I informed the waitress that I didn't care to pay an entree price for a plate of greens and refused the meal.  Throughout the entire interaction, the waitress was nothing but curt and impersonal (with the exception of when when I refused the plate, asking if I could be brought anything else, which was clearly ruled out during the earlier conversation).  I decided to substitute my meal with several beers, each of which I had to flag the waitress down and request.  If you're looking for a friendly atmosphere and attention to your experience, I'd choose another restaurant.  Plus side is there were plenty of vegan beers to choose from","Name: Thai Basil; Review: Great food, they have a super decent amount of vegan option!

Name: Citrus & Salt Boston; Review: I was a little disappointed that there wasn't more vegan options on their menu. The waitress was super nice and made us ""custom"" vegan tacos but it was literally just a slice of avocado with picked onion on it LMAO! THAT I could've easily made at home and not gone out to pay $12 for 2 slices of avocado on a tortilla. We were celebrating our friends bday and they got churros for our friend and got my husband&I a little vegan coconut fruit sorbet, which was nice! (I thought it was out of the kindness of their heart but ofcourse it wasn't, they upcharged for it) Their drinks are fun and have funny names! The decor is great here but the menu is ehh. Mexican food can easily be made vegan because it's all plant based but I'm disappointed they didn't have more of a tailoring to it when we told them except their suggestions for chips or gauc. Hope this changes in the future

Name: Oasis Vegan Veggie Parlor; Review: This is one of the top 5 vegetarian restaurants in New England, nevermind Boston!  The food is drop jaw delicious. The atmosphere is a blend of East Africa and Caribbean mixed with just the right amount of hippie and overflowing with love and welcoming energy!  The food is in your face flavorful. You will not walk away from here without tired taste buds, in a good way.  We got the ""everything"", and a tiger blood smoothie.  There was two of us and we couldn't even finish half of the food!!  Took it home for dinner. I think it weighed four pounds!!  The spices in the smoothie made you want to keep sipping, it was addictive.  Love this place, my only complaint is I didn't visit sooner!

Name: El Paso Enchiladas; Review: VEGAN OPTIONS GUYS in a sea of non-vegan restaurants. Such a sight for sore eyes when I saw these vegan empanadas. They are edible, not the best ones I've ever had but decent. Prices are fair. Staff is nice and friendly

Name: by CHLOE. - Boston Seaport; Review: It took me a while to figure out how I really felt about by CHLOE. Being a plant-based eater, I was so excited to try it the first time. I wasn’t blown away but I wasn’t disappointed either. I’ve since been back a handful of times to keep trying. Here are my thoughts:  The veggie burgers are average. Granted, it’s hard to get a good one but I had high hopes for a restaurant that’s selling point is vegan food.  The avocado toast is pretty good. I was really banking on that one and was pleased when I tried it. Great avocado go bread ratio and interesting selection of toppings.  Regular fries are alright. If you salt them, they’re much better. Sweet potato fries are excellent. Note: beet ketchup will probably throw you off at first. I’m a tomato ketchup lover so it doesn’t really do it for me.  Pancakes are great. I’ve had vegan pancakes elsewhere and these are some of the best. Great consistency and not overly sweet. The matcha and chocolate really make it.  I didn’t love the matcha blueberry muffin. It was dry and stuck to the paper. It also made a huge mess.  Chocolate ice cream is excellent.  I took a few bites of the gf chocolate cupcake and can tell you it’s mighty tasty. The frosting is nicely whipped.  My absolute favorite, however, would be the gf chocolate chip cookies. They’re the overall best cookies I’ve ever had in my life and I have had a lot of cookies.  I’ll continue to work my way through the menu. Again, I would not consider it the best vegan spot or even the best fast food style vegan eatery. But it’ll do","Name: Flour Bakery; Review: Visiting Boston for the weekend and stumbled upon Flour Bakery. Giving us the local feel with the added customer service.  Refreshing to find a cafe with so many vegan options. I ordered a mouth watering vegan double chocolate muffin. The cashier suggested it be warned, she was not wrong! That thing was deliciousssssssss.  Be a little patient, it’s located in a high traffic intersection (hospital and hotels)

Name: Cafe Bonjour; Review: For two residents of South Florida taking their first trip to Boston, our main objective was maximizing our short 5 day visit with as much as excursion and warmth as possible. Our tour of Boston was filled with adventure and history at the turn of every corner, and our commutes were alluring as each restaurant we passed by offered a hug and a warming embrace from an ever diverse city with their unique and tantalizing dishes from their respective cultures. The food alone provides visitors with enough reason to plan their return to the city as each restaurant and vendor has an inviting menu and an enticing aroma. On our second to last day, we would stumble upon a blossoming French breakfast cafe where a passionate chef is working tirelessly seven days a week offering a taste of classical French cuisine. A breakfast so good that we would return before our flight home. If you are looking for an excellent meal with a warm and engaging environment, where the owners make you feel like family and serve dishes that will touch your heart, look no further than Cafe Bonjour in downtown Boston (Easily accessible from the orange line at the downtown crossing stop).  When you walk in, the small cozy spot has a calming atmosphere only accentuated by its friendly staff. A small yet abundant menu will offer a selection for any visitor with meatless, gluten-free, and plant based based varieties as well. With an open kitchen, there are no surprises into what owner Driss is serving up on a plate. Attention to detail and sourcing fresh local ingredients combined with the chef's passion for cooking is what makes these French classics stand out. Every dish is made to order and each simple ingredient is prepared right. Moreover, the portions are reasonably priced and will not leave you hungry. Quality over quantity definitely shines in chef Driss's kitchen and it was truly a delight to be served such delicious food.  The dishes we ordered included the Croque Madame Croissant, the Croque Monsieur Baguette, the Fruit and Yogurt Cup, the Signature Blueberry Bowl, the Avacodo Egg White Wrap, the Plant-Based Sausage and Egg Sandwich, and the Bonjour Classic Crepe topped with nutella, strawberries, and bananas. We washed them down with cappuccinos and a plant-based dairy free fruit smoothie called the Serene. The food will speak for itself. I regret not staying longer to try everything. I dare any visitor to find a bad dish on the menu. Thank you Driss and everyone there for making us feel at home and serving us food better than we ever anticipated. We're already looking forward to our next visit. We wish you the best of luck with the business and may the future be filled with great success for you and your family. We made it back to Florida safely. We'll see you all next time

Name: Pho Boston; Review: Quaint little space, very reasonable prices, and attentive service. The vegetarian pho and stir fry dishes we ordered were delicious and came out fast. One important thing to note is that if we hadn't inquired about it, even the vegetarian dishes we ordered would have been prepared with oyster sauce as almost everything on their menu contains. Appreciated that our server offered to ensure what we ordered would be made truly vegetarian. We certainly will be back

Name: Kaju Korean Cuisine — Kenmore; Review: This place has a decent selection of vegetarian items plainly marked on their menu. Being an Asian spot, vegetarian items are usually easily veganized (I'm vegan), and this place was no exception. One just need ask for no egg, and maybe double check to make sure no dairy is involved but, I've never encountered this. I had the veggie & tofu clay pot, vegan style. It was awesome. The pot was stupid temperature hot, as is needed to do a good clay/hot pot dish, and caramelized the rice/sauce mixture perfectly. I do wish they would have had any options for adding spice heat to one's dish. They had sriracha but no dry chilis or chilis in oil or things of that nature. That would have put this place over the top. I would recommend this place to vegans & vegetarian (and meaty meats) without hesitation"
I want some fresh sashimi,"Name: Avana Sushi; Review: Quick service, good sashimi. Can get crowded as there are other restaurants in this food court. The place next to Avana has excellent desserts
Name: Fin's Sushi + Grill; Review: Incredibly delicious sushi at amazing prices! The salmon here literally tastes like butter, and when they brought the check, I thought they had missed some things because it was so low. I would recommend the salmon combo (2 maki rolls and a hand roll), the sashimi appetizer (10 pieces of sashimi), and the ocean roll (the honey wasabi sauce is incredible). The service is very quick and attentive, and the place itself is cute and has a nice atmosphere. Would come back again in a heartbeat
Name: Sushiemon; Review: Absurd quality of food, horrible service. I have never written a review but I feel as though this restaurant deserves one. The sushi wasnt fresh and the sashimi on it was smaller than I'd ever seen. My friend almost threw up because of the quality of the fish. I can only hope that they improve their services soon
Name: Sushiemon; Review: I love this place. I'm here almost every day because the fish is fresh and high quality and the price is right. Owner is a really cool guy and knows his trade. I'm trying to ear healthier and have added the salmon/tuna/scallop sashimi as a regular part of my diet
Name: Crazy Stone; Review: Crazy Stone has some of the best sashimi I've had in a while! I will definitely be going again and trying some of their special rolls, but I think the quality of sashimi is the most important when looking for a sushi spot. They also have a full menu, with entrees from tempura, and teriyaki to wok and grill, as well as soups, salads, noodles, and of course what generally comes last, desserts.  I will definitely be getting Crazy Stone takeout this winter, and I look forward to sitting down to a boat of sushi with friends at a table overlooking the pond in the summer","Name: Umai; Review: First of all, the service here is phenomenal. The waiter was very attentive and even asked about our fish preferences or anything we wanted to avoid in the chirashi and the sashimi regular. He also stopped by regularly to make sure everything was fine.  The fish is fresh, and the dishes we got had a lot of variety. (The scallop that came with the chirashi was surprisingly huge!) I had sea bass sashimi for the first time in the sashimi regular and absolutely loved it, and the mackerel was amazing. It's not as cheap as sushi can be in other places, but the price is very reasonable for the quality, variety, and amount you get, especially in Boston
Name: sushi time; Review: Been going here since highschool ( im in my 30's now). Today, all I wanted was some salmon sashimi for lunch. I sat down to enjoy my lunch to find out the center was still frozen. I wanted to go back and let them know but I was just so hungry and didn't have time. Paid over $10 for frozen fish. Will not be back anytime soon but prob will visit again due my long years of visits without fail in the past
Name: Ginza Japanese; Review: Ordered chirashi (bowl of sushi rice with raw fish on top). Salad and miso soup were included as starters. The rice when it arrived was very nicely presented, and it was interesting to see that they have put two kind of furikake on top of the rice before laying the fish on it. All the fish tasted fresh, though I kind of wish there is more in quantity or variety. Still, this is one of the cheaper choices on the menu so I guess it is reasonable. Would come again to try some of their larger sushi sets

Name: Sakurabana; Review: Stopped in on a Monday for take-out sushi for lunch. It was busy. 25 min wait for takeout, which to me is usually a good sign because that means that sushi was just made. I ordered three different things, sushi chetta, passion roll, and the sashimi sampler.  I was a little disappointed with the fish itself. It honestly tasted a little ""fishy"" and not as clean as I had hoped. The combination of flavors was nice, to include the shiso leaf. My girlfriend was not a fan of the ginger inside the roll.  They also forgot to include any soy sauce packets in our to go order. The person taking my order was a little curt, but I can chalk that up to it being busy.

Name: Rosa Mexicano; Review: After having visited Rosa Mexicano a few times, I do have to say that sitting at the bar for drinks and made-to-order guacamole is significantly better than going for a meal. The bartenders are great, and the tableside guacamole is a little on the salty side, but still delicious. Their margaritas are all made with fresh juices, so there's no artificial triple sec here -- a definite plus. However, meals here are a different story. My most recent trip there was for brunch. In addition to needing to ask for the brunch menu (we were given the lunch menu) and the waiter filling an already-full water glass, spilling water everywhere (an honest mistake), what I ordered is not what I received. Let me explain: I ordered the egg white burrito, which should have contained herb-scrambled egg whites, arugula, queso fresco, and tomatoes in a whole wheat tortilla. I got a burrito with egg whites in it, and that's about where the similarities end. There were no herbs, there was romaine and asparagus instead of arugula, there was no cheese, and the tortilla was white, not whole wheat. I ate it instead of sending it back, because my friends and I were on a bit of a deadline. I feel as though the server should have said that there were some substitutions to the dish that needed to be made, rather than just presenting me with a dish that was completely different from what I ordered. The whole experience was a little bizarre, and from now on I will only go back to get drinks and guacamole
Name: Amelia's Taqueria; Review: I have loved amelias for years, but they have changed a lot on their menu during covid and it isn’t nearly as good. The rice has no seasoning and the refried beans seems more like charro beans. My husbands chicken had no seasoning either. I’m sure they’re trying to save money because they’ve been hit hard by COVID. I still think they’re better than chipotle. But, I really miss the beans. That’s what I used to go there for.  Original review:  First, know that I am born and raised in Texas so I have strong opinions about Mexican food. Next I will say that this food is delicious. It is what I have been missing since I moved up to Boston. The refried beans are incredible. I would eat a gallon of these in a heartbeat. The guacamole is also great, but for me it’s all about the beans. They are also the nicest staff. They gave me some free tortillas. They are incredible. 15/10 would recommend","Name: Qdoba; Review: AMAZING! I normally get burritos from chipotle, but this is just a good.

Name: Rosa Mexicano; Review: After having visited Rosa Mexicano a few times, I do have to say that sitting at the bar for drinks and made-to-order guacamole is significantly better than going for a meal.

Name: El Paso Enchiladas; Review: Quite possibly the worst Mexican food I’ve had inside or outside the US. The chicken was sweet and maybe cooked in just Tabasco. The guacamole was gummy; instead of just falling off the spoon it sort of oozed like it was full of fillers or something to make it more gooey than any other guacamole I’ve seen. I’ve lived in New Mexico, California, and Arizona, as well as MA. I’ve seen good and bad Mexican food of all Mexican food regions. This was just so abysmally terrible I had to throw away my entire meal. I feel terrible for the poor chickens and farmers who contributed to this meal

Name: Loco Taqueria & Oyster Bar; Review: Came here again and had an equally good experience albeit the long wait.  Came at 7:30 on a Tuesday night and the place was packed. If you don't like waiting, definitely try to make a reservation. We waited about an hour for 2 and had some margaritas while we were waiting (The Little Devil, which is deliciously spicy with jalapeno-infused tequila).  Everything we ordered was delicious...the Guac is some of the best I've had and their pica de gallo is simple but so fresh-tasting.  We ordered 4 of the tacos to share and here is what I would recommend in order: 1. Carne Asada (I'm biased because this also came with guac on it) 2. Cajun Roasted Chicken (this came with some sweet pineapple salsa on there as well) 3. Braised Short Rib 4. Fried shrimp (I just wish the shrimp were bigger)  Tacos are probably on the more expensive side vs. what you can get elsewhere but it's a nicer place.  I will continue to come back to Loco"
I need good kimchi,"Name: Korean Asian Kitchen - Mission Hill Roxbury; Review: This is my 4th time ordering food from this place. The food I don't have a problem with, I like it a lot and its a 5 star for me. But the people here are ALWAYS forgetting something in my orders. I even write down the notes on uber eats to please don't forget the utensils and they still manage to forget them. Just order now, and they didn't bring kimchi, when I even add extra kimchi to the order. They didn't send the korean chilly sauce. Maybe will only order for pickup next time to make sure everything is there
Name: OliToki; Review: Definitely go with friends so you can order a lot and share. Great prices, speedy service, outstanding value. When you need a little variety in your tacos, Korean fusion is the way to go. I wasn't quite sure how it would turn out the first time I ate there and my fears disappeared immediately. I usually go for the tacos with chicken, but the seasoned pork and bulgogi beef are worth having. The burritos are out of this world with bacon fried rice & kimchi, and both the totchos and ramen-seasoned fries are a must-try. (Ignore the ketchup packets with the fries.) And the kimchi rice balls are perfect for fans of arancini
Name: OliToki; Review: This place is amazing. I ate here like 5 times in the last month. The boneless wings are amazing with the OliToki sauce. The Taco's are great. The burrito's wicked good. I HATE kimchi but the Kimchi Fried Rice Balls with bacon are sinfully good. Also with direct competition from other Korean-X fusion places in a five minute walking distance they lead the pack!  Also, if your are feeling as if you want to try a Filipino style side, try the Spam Matsubi.  The only thing that didn't blow me away was the bowl, but I may have been expecting something different in my mind
Name: Seoul Restaurant; Review: Food: mediocre Service: mediocre Ambiance:  pretty good  We came in at 2 and it was not busy, but there were a couple of tables. We ordered the tteokbokki mix and kimchi pancake. The tteokbokki mix (meant for two) was brought out to us and placed on a burner, where we were suppose to cook and watch out for. Now, we weren't  sure when the mix was suppose to be done and had no idea if we were suppose to shut it off at all...so we kinda burned it . So ofc the mix didn't taste good at all since it was burnt and had the taste of it being burned. The mix was also sweet, unlike what I was excepting it to be (salty). For the kimchi pancake, the texture I liked (it was chewy) but it LACKED flavor. There was no kimchi flavor or anything. The sauce that did cake with it was not good (I think it was just vinegar and hot oil). All in all the food was disappointing as the flavor was either lacking or just not what we expected (maybe the mix would've tasted better if it wasn't burnt? but I doubt it as it the sauce was sweet when we wanted salty).  So to end this...I wouldn't come back personally as the food we did order was not good and under our expectations, but I don't wanna say their other items are bad as well. Try Seoul if it's your last option, but if there's other Korean places nearby choose those instead

This is my third time ordering from Kimchipapi. I tried the Japchae the first time and was hooked! Seriously delicious! I also had the crab salad hotdog and the Okonomi hot dog which were mind blowingly succulent! I went in person today and the service was excellent. I told them I was a cancer patient who’s is neutropenic and needed my food well done and the gentleman kindly obliged. Totally recommend this place to anyone! ❤️❤️❤️💯💯💯🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾😋😋

Name: kimchipapi kitchen; Review: Super busy place even during a pandemic (which is great for them) because it's in a college area. Called to order food on a Sat night around 730pm. Person on the phone said it was a 35min wait for food. No problem. Went in 35mins later and the food weren't ready yet. They had so many orders for ubereats. So my order wasnt actually ready until closer to 1hr later when the call was made. My bf waited inside the restaurant while i watched the car and the location is hard to find parking so that was my worry. If we knew it would take longer than 35mins to wait for the food, we wouldn't have come here sooner just to wait. Called around 730pm and got the food closer to 830pm. Not really a big deal since i understand they're busy but this is our first experience with the restaurant. Will know better next time not to come too early to pick up food.  Ordered food for 3ppl (2 corn dogs, crab salad, 3 bowls). We like and enjoy the food. Our first time eating korean street corn dogs. We were excited for it and it did not disappoint for take out (would taste even better if eaten fresh out the fryer). The only i didnt like was that my kimchimama bowl because they added way too much sauce. Had way too much gochuchang sauce (high acidity) for me. Couldnt even finish half of my bowl. Other 2 bowls had the right amount of sauce on it. Overall, we still enjoy the food and would definitely come back to try other foods but probably just not on a weekend night

Name: kimchipapi kitchen; Review: The newest and hippest establishment on the block. With a name like Kimchi Papi and the owner risking it all as the franchise's mascot, it's caught my attention enough for me to try.  Food: See pic (65%) Taste to price 4/5 Quality to price 4/5 Portion to price 4/5 Average = 4  Service (20%) Friendliness 3/5 Promptness 4/5 Average = 3.5  Cleanliness (15%) Bathroom n/a Dining area 5/5 Kitchen area 5/5 Average = 5  Overall Score = [F(.65)]+[S(.20)]+C(.15)] = [2.6]+[0.7]+[0.75] = 4.05  What else to know: In every way, the food matches their marketing efforts, bold and confident. When you look over at the wall, there's a sign requesting to send ""noodz"". Well played Kimchi Papi, well played sir. Since you asked nicely, below is my Bibim Nood Bowl which I made sure was shot under good lighting and angle for your pleasure. If you drool, it was well intended ;) The bowl was delicious and if you're not in the mood for noodz, no worries as you can make your own bowl. When you look over to their toppings bar, you'll see a plethora of it. With a creative menu, refreshing ambiance, and a clean kitchen/dining area to match, this place is easily the best in Allston to grab poke

Name: kimchipapi kitchen; Review: Wow. This place is just wow. I ordered food from them on uber eats last night and let me tell you this. I am one picky eater and this was my first time having korean corndogs and THEY WERE AMAZING. I got the regular hot dog one and also the mozzarella one. I also ordered their DTF fries, their Buffalo chicken sliders and their fried Oreos. Literally everything was amazing. And the thing is i ate all of it up SO QUICK it was just so good. This is my first real review ever and let me tell yall this. This place is SOOO UNDERRATED. I will be coming  here in person really soon! Thank you guys for the amazing food and keep it up!!!!!!!!","Name: Suishaya; Review: My friends and I visited on a Saturday evening and ordered Korean dishes. The ban chan (Korean side dishes) were pretty sparse for 3 people, and we had to ask for additional kimchi halfway through the meal. The main dishes (kimchi jjigae and deok mandu guk) were decent, not great, but arrived piping hot and in great quantity- more than enough for leftovers. The restaurant is nice, but pretty tiny- it was awkward for guests and servers alike to navigate the dining area. They play older Kpop videos on a TV above the bar area, which is fun; very Big Bang biased (which almost earns it an extra star from me!). A good value and fun atmosphere; solid for Korean food

Name: Kaju Korean Cuisine — Kenmore; Review: Had the combo meal with “pork belly” and tofu soup, medium spicy. The pork was tough and dried out and my guess is that it was actually pieces of over cooked pork chop rather than the advertised “pork belly”. Soup was ok as well as the kimchee and other condiments, rice was on the dry side. Overall the menu seems overpriced and while you may have a better experience with dishes other than the pork, they definitely are overreaching in describing the food as “Korean Gourmet”

Name: Bonne Chance Cafe; Review: This place doesn't look like much from the outside, but inside? Friendly service and a salad bar I can only describe as ""generous."" Really thoughtful and unexpected options (add a kimchi dumpling, some roasted zucchini or any number of prepared egg, pasta, lentil, etc. salads to your to-go container). As a vegetarian, I appreciate all the options to have a delicious, healthy lunch.  Their hot meals (bibimbap, tofu and rice with veggies, etc.) are enough for two meals.  Everything comes at a nice price and with friendly service.  Servic

Name: Kayuga; Review: Found out about the place because it was nearby, and it opens until very late. Came in and really liked the decor, they have large tables with high seats to accommodate for groups for more private settings. They have a menu as well as a condensed version including their popular options.  We got the budae jigae (Korean army stew with ramen, spam, rice cakes, pork belly, hotdogs, kimchi) and the soon far (Korean blood sausage stuffed with vermicelli). For the price, the stew was worth it ($32 for a portion good enough for two, if not more), but the sausage was definitely on the pricier end ($19). Comes with side dishes like kimchi, pickled cucumbers, even hotdogs and jalapenos. We were very full and had a lot of leftovers.  Would come back for the stew

Name: kimchipapi kitchen; Review: The Kimchi Bowl is awesome. The ingredients are perfect as is. Great textures and flavors.  The Korean Street Corndog is very different. It's very similar to a corndog but the outside is very crispy. The addition of sugar, ketchup, and mustard elevates the whole experience!  The Krispy Boneless chicken is super good. Tender, juicy, crispy, and the sauce options are great. I would suggest maybe getting a bit of extra sauce on the side but not on top as it will decrease the great crispness. Very easy to eat as you don't have to use your hands like you would for Wings.  Definitely recommend this place if you are in the mood for some Korean fried chicken or poke bowl"
"I am looking for a quiet, vibey, cozy restaurant","Name: Broadside Tavern; Review: Three of my team members met here after work for drinks and dinner on a Wednesday night. The service was great, and the food good - though the salad I had was probably large enough to feed two people, something one of my colleagues also found. The beer list was very long, with something for everyone. While not huge, we were all surprised at how quiet the place was - no more than a third full. It certainly didn't impact our evening, but we were a bit surprised. It's possible that this was just a quiet night though, and I would definitely come back
Name: MC Spiedo; Review: Good food and a nice atmosphere which varies between modern and cozy depending on what part of the restaurant you're in. The waiter was very helpful and recommended a bottle of wine for us that wasn't on the menu

Name: The Maiden; Review: Hailing from Southie restaurant chops under Sam’s, the owner of The Maiden live up to their longstanding reputation. While seemingly quiet and not crowded, The Maidens serves up food and an experience worthy of an hour wait. I love the quirky wine and cocktail menus, the steak tartare was the 2nd best I’ve ever had (and I’ve tasted a lot), and the duck is a meal I’ll continually dream about until I can have it again. The gentleman who manages the floor, who I believe is also part owner, is a delight with a quiet but commanding presence on the floor. Really special experience you can’t get most places in Boston
Name: Deuxave; Review: The service was pretty good in general. My waiter was very nice and perfectly behaved. Other staffs were generally polite with a bit contempt (which is somewhat understandable in a French restaurant). But there are a few problems both in the cuisine and service that I believe can be improved. First is about the food. The 9-hour onion soup was horrifically salty and the cheese clung tightly to my spoon immediately after I took it out of the soup. Maybe I was wrong about this soup but I thought the cheese was supposed to melt. Another thing about the food was that I asked for medium-done steak, but they gave me rare. I was a bit disgusted when eating the meat but still, edible. This course was rich in amount. Farro Risotto was great at the beginning but after a few bites, it turned out to be too creamy and cloying (especially with the SWEET onion sauce) to be enjoyable. It is kind of sad to have my rare beef as a refreshment  for Farro Risotto. It should be the other way around. The last thing was about the seating. I asked for a quiet, private place but they put me in the middle of the hall, surrounded by four tables. I was quite uncomfortable to start with but I tried to tolerate it until half an hour later, the sun went down and a strong reflection of sunlight directly struck my face. I asked to be re-seated and one of the staffs was more than impatient. But my waiter was very nice about this and put me to a quiet place at the corner. Anyways, I hope this helps if you are looking for a perfect experience. I may not recommend this restaurant if you are looking for something light . Everything seemed to be sweetened there","Name: Sterling’s; Review: Not a quiet place to relax and eat. We usually grab a bite to eat at Quency Market but this day we decided to look for a sit-down restaurant. This place is not far from the market. At the restaurant entrance we asked for a table but were turned around and seated outdoors. We were all hungry so we stayed and ordered. There was a bar outdoors, a d-jay, and people playing corn hole within 10 feet of our table. The food was hot but the quality did not reflect the price we paid. The waiter never returned to ask how our meal was and took his time bringing the check. We won't eat here again. If you're looking for a relaxing dinner this is not the place. Please give a thumbs up if this review was helpful. Thanks

Name: Yvonne's; Review: I came here with two friends for a Thursday night dinner. Our reservation was for 7pm.  A little tricky to find this spot if you haven't been here before, there's a pedestrian walkway and the entrance sort of looks like an abandoned hair salon with a few well dressed people inside. I thought I entered the wrong door at first, but they quickly told me I was in the right spot when they saw my confusion.  Once you walk inside the actual restaurant, it's like walking through a door to another world--super hopping. It's kind of a club atmosphere. Baroque wall paper, chandeliers, there are a couple bars and a couple rooms. A coat check. At 7 on a Thursday the bar was FULL of the afterwork crowd. It looks to be a lot of people in their 20s. Lots of business professional outfits. I felt a little old (and happy I wore shoes instead of boots despite the cold!). It was also super loud--not the best place to catch up with friends. I think it would be fun if you wanted to go out on the town or do a bachelorette party.  The host and waiter were really nice. What was really odd was the pacing of food. We almost immediately got 3 of our 5 dishes. Finished them, then waited for approx 30 minutes until the last 2 dishes arrived. We had to ask our waiter about them and then he fired them, I'm not usually picky about timing of plates, but it was noticeably weird. We also had to flag someone down for the check.  We ordered cocktails and 5 dishes. I had the mezcal cocktail which was smoky and great. The chicken quinoa meatballs (so good) Crispy potatoes-the sauce was great, but I wouldn't necessarily get it again, though there were crispy and good. The kale and orzo salad-I'm not sure I'd do kale and orzo together, it was good but not great The pita was awesome--more of a pizza than a pita, I was SO glad we got it. The grilled halloumi was good, salty cheese on crisp baguettes. It was good, but not super memorable.  I think I'd leave this place to the younger crowd, but there are certainly some great dishes and cocktails to try here

Name: 753 South; Review: Fine dining but in an alley.  Hard to knock the alley seating during the pandemic, but still would've like to experience the patio.  The service was amazing and menu diverse.  Palenta Twinkie was a treat as well as the shoshito peppers.  Lobster roll was large and had generous portions of meat.  Salmon was well cooked and had very flavorful sides.  My only complaint is the liquor menu which is very expensive. Expect to pay 9 dollars for a draft beer, which just really feels bad and sort of distracted me from the meal while debating a second beer.

It's large, spacious, somewhat theatrical with bar seating areas, a pub tv area and traditional restaurant seating as well. The food was well-prepared we had both short ribs and lobster. For dessert the gelato tasty as well. service was prompt and the people were incredibly friendly. However, perhaps it was just the emptiness of the restaurant on a Thursday night with a vast open spaces that made it feel sterile and lonely. I'm not quite sure why, but the atmosphere felt somewhat lacking. That being said all-in I'd give the food an A- and the dining experience a B+

The meals are yummy and the crew is very friendly and cooperative. Whenever we go to this place we enjoy a delightful evening.  I warmly recommend this restaurant

Name: Good Life; Review: Being an active eater in downtown Boston I'm pretty surprised I haven't eaten here before now. I always walked by and assumed it was only an evening place. Not at all. Sat at the bar for lunch. Not only is the staff really super nice and inviting, but it gives you a pub vibe with some dim lighting great wooden bar. My type of vibe. Most importantly the menu has all your lunch favorites and the food is great. Their fries are fresh cut and the food is what you want it to be. Great burger. I haven't been after 5 but its unique space with a basement  vodka bar, is telling me I should check it out when I get the urge to have some fun. Definitely in the rotation no

Name: Modern Underground; Review: This place is amazing! The vibes are so fun and cozy I love that it has a speakeasy feel and the bartender is super friendly! The food was incredible and they have special menus for special times (New Years, valentines, etc..). So many delicious options on their brunch and dinner menu good luck narrowing it down! And don't forget to stop upstairs and grab some pastries and cannolis on the way out

Name: The Hungry I; Review: If you're looking for a cozy place for dinner, this is it. The owner is very personable and very welcoming. Small nook with interesting decorations, this place serves up some good food.  It's a little pricey and wine does not  come by the glass. Service is good but expect to have a longer than usual wait. The atmosphere is great: dimly lit, warm, brick and wood, cozy"
Restaurants for first date,"Name: Petit Robert Bistro; Review: I came here on a date after I mentioned that I had never really had quality French food before. My date made a reservation and it wasn't too busy for 6:30pm on a Thursday night, but we were seated right away. We had the option to sit outside or inside, and we chose to sit outside since it was a nice day and the neighborhood seemed quiet. We ordered the escargots and half a dozen oysters to start, and they were both absolutely delicious. The escargots were flavorful, and the oysters were extremely refreshing. For our entrees, I ordered the scallops and my date ordered the pork. The pork looked like it was breaded, which surprised my date, since he was here last year and it was prepared differently then. It was still tasty, but maybe a tad overcooked. The scallops were cooked perfectly though so I had no complaints! I took off one star for the service since it wasn't the quickest. Overall, I wouldn't mind coming back
Name: 29 Newbury Street Restaurant; Review: NEAT PLACE TO DROP IN AFTER A DAY DATE ON THE BLOCK.  A BIT OVER THE TOP..
Name: Emerald Rose; Review: Dined in on a Thursday night with a date.  It was slightly busy for a weekday but still got seated in a booth right away. Ordered 1 glass of wine to start. Took well over 5 mins to get it then I ordered a steak cooked medium with fries. The steak came out very quick, was cooked rare and had mashed potatoes instead. Had to send back 3 different times: Once to get fries, twice once I noticed the undercook, and again because it was still medium rare. I felt like I was being punked the whole time. My date's meal had no issues. The waitress was hard to get a hold of and never wrote anything down which is probably why it got so jacked. I was not compensated in any way but I didn't want to make a scene. The food was decent enough at ok prices but I'm not sure if I want to go back. At least I had a hot date to distract me
Name: Basho Japanese Brasserie; Review: Honestly, I don't know what the place is like now but it popped up in my feed as a place I went to 7 years ago and — Of course I'll leave a review for it, Google.  Basho. I had the best date ever here on a cold winter night. The room was quaint. Our food filled the small table. It was the first time I tried sashimi (enjoyed it). My date and I had some wine... It's all happy thoughts. This place left an impression so it will always get 5 stars in my book
Name: Max & Dylans Kitchen Bar; Review: I really like this place, especially the space it is in. Menu is large but not overwhelming, some good cocktail options, all around a very comfortable dinner. Great for a dinner with friends, after work drinks, or a casual date","Name: Mexican Restaurant, Mini Buffet; Review: At the first moment  you come to that restaurant  the stuff gives you an agreeable feeling. Very friendly stuff, it is a lovely place to  enjoy with buddies or with your date. tasty  meals, qualified  chef de cuisine, comfortable  pay and attentive  service. Warmly recommended
Name: Alcove; Review: I took my date here for valentine's Day 2021. Reserved a fire pit as it seemed like a good idea at the time. The fire pit had two mostly burned down quarter logs in it. Which although we requested more, the staff seemed to have been instructed to not give. I wouldn't have an issue with this if I wasn't being charged 50 dollars for the fire pit experience. Give me what I'm paying for please.  In terms of pricing, I found the meals over priced and underdelivered. The burger was nothing special. It's ingredients also nothing special. I've had better burgers for a quarter the cost with both better taste and quality. The menu was also highly lacking in options and some of those weren't even available. The appetizer we ordered(zucchini fritters) was overcooked on the outside and undercooked on the inside. It was also too potently spiced. The desert tasted little better than something you'd find in a trader joe's bakery section. So not bad but, unlike trader joe's where you get a whole box you only get a handful.  TLDR: -it's a bad sign when the staff are eating pizza from another establishment instead of their own work places food. - I've never spent 200+ dollars, ordered an appetizer, entree, and dessert, and walked away hungry. -for the same price I could've flown my date and I to Kenosha wisconsin first class, ate significantly better food, and then flown back. Which I'll probably do next time as it'll be an overall better experience.  Although, I will say the waitress we had was excellent and did her job well. Of the entire experience, the tip I gave her was the only part of the payment I made that I have no regret over
Name: 29 Newbury Street Restaurant; Review: NEAT PLACE TO DROP IN AFTER A DAY DATE ON THE BLOCK.  A BIT OVER THE TOP..
Name: Mario's Restaurant; Review: Went in for a double date.... Walked in and it wasny to crowded but quickly filled up. So making a reservation might be a must on the weekend.  The wine was inexpensive which was perfect and the food was great. Portion sizes are large - my type of place - and the server had the Italian grandma vibe which was perfect. She recommended a few food items and she was ON POINT! so good.... The food felt authentic but im not Italian Sooo how much would I really know about that.... But I have gone to Italy which was heaven but thats another story...... The Service wasnt the super quick one where you feel like they are trying to kick you out... But not super slow where you are dying to pay the bill. The bathroom was fine, nothing special with it. The ONLY issue isnt with the restaurant but parking could be tricky. Therr are a lot of food places around it so ypuau have to drive around for a bit to find a spot

Name: Max & Dylans Kitchen Bar; Review: Came here on a whim after going to see the nutcracker and was pleasantly surprised! Tried a few dishes and everything was phenomenal! Great food service and wine ;-) I highly recommend for any date night","Name: Bricco; Review: Overall it was decent... but wasn't what I was hoping it would be.  I went to dinner with my boyfriend to celebrate our 6 months anniversary so I was looking for a ""romantic"" spot for dinner. This place does not NOT have romantic ambiance like Yelp and OpenTable states. So don't be fooled. The place is very casual, so don't dress up. It has nice scenery inside, but it's casual.  Our waitress was okay, but used a 100% fake Italian accent the entire time we were there and would constantly switch between speaking normal english to speaking italian words with a clearly fake accent. This made her very difficult to understand and overall left us with weird vibes and confused. The waitress at the table next to us even recited different options for the night's specialty items. When I asked our waitress about one of the options the other waitress mentioned, she quickly came back with an excuse that she didn't mention the pesto dish because the other options were much more authentic... So this left me confused, uncomfortable about the restaurant food, & still unsure about what I wanted for dinner.  My advice would be to stick with their popular dishes because that seems to be what they are good at, ie. the Ricotta Pillows and the Wild Boar Pappardelle. That is what my boyfriend and I ended up ordering and it was quite good, but I wouldn't recommend veering too far from Bricco's comfort zone (view Yelp pictures) because you may end up getting something you didn't order (this happened to the couple next to us with the same waitress as us). This seems to happen a lot here from what I read in Google and Yelp reviews, so beware, those reviews are the truth. (I'm thinking it has something to do with the ""language barrier""....ha)  I noticed when I got to the restaurant that the manager actually owns a few different places throughout the North End, & from my experience this really affects the quality of the restaurant including food and definitely service. Something to keep in mind if you don't enjoy chain(-like) restaurants

Name: Ruth's Chris Steak House; Review: So I decided to finally try the famous Ruth's Chris once and for all. Made reservations for Valentines Day for me and my girlfriend of three years. So, we show up and off the bat, I'm impressed with the design and where they decided to place the restaurant. Old City Hall, giving it that classy effect.  On the way in, we are greeted by our hostess who before she seats us asks if we want a picture and takes one for us and then proceeds to give us a tour before she seats us. Impressive service.  The table's décor consisted of rose pedals scattered strategically over the table with relaxing music playing in the background. Fellas, this is the place you want to bring your woman on Valentines Day.  Anyways, on to the food. We ordered barbecue shrimp for the appetizer which was what I expected of it. Nothing special, just a decent appetizer. I would've tried the calamari but my girlfriend is picky.  For our entrée, we ordered the porterhouse for two, the au gratin potatoes and broccoli. Let me just tell you about this steak. It is single handedly the best steak I've EVER HAD in my natural life. I've never wrote a review for a restaurant but this place is more than worthy for one just for the steak alone. Our server gave each of us a plate that was 500 degrees filled with this butter sauce which he put a piece of the steak on for each of us. Just watching the steak sizzling in the butter and smelling it is worth the trip but tasting it is worth the trip back!!  It tasted like they cut the cow in the back and cooked it. Nah seriously. AMAZING!  Our server was top notch too, I wish I remembered his name but he was excellent! Overall 5 out of 5 for this spot. Def. pricey but worth every last dollar I spent in that place which was about 3 bills.(Then again I popped a bottle of Moet too.)  HIGHLY RECOMMENED AND IVE BEEN EVERYWHERE!

Name: Great Taste; Review: Great food I would really recommend the hamburgers or the wings there really amazing I have came back multiple times it's an amazing restaurant I met the owners they are really nice I really recommend this restauran

Name: Live Noodles; Review: Just had the worst dinning experience. A really long piece of hair in my dish!!! What's worse??? The waiter still charged me for the dish with hair because he said I ate a portion of it!!! In the end, the waiter asked us to pay tips and told us to never come back!!! I will never come back for sure!!! Even if he didn't say so!!

Name: The Capital Grille; Review: Great atmosphere, amazing food. We arrived 10 minutes before our reservation and were greeted and promptly seated with a reminder they allotted 90min for each guest due to Covid capacity guidelines. When our waiter came over he again mentioned we had 90 minutes and asked a if we wanted drinks. I began to look over the cocktail list to which he said again “You have 90 minutes” and walked away. I told my date my order and went to the restroom. When I returned the waiter had a hard copy of the menu waiting for me he thought maybe my phone was too slow.... because we only have 90 minutes. We had been in the restaurant a total of 8 minutes by now. The food was absolutely delicious (Id recommend the Rib-eye to a cow) drinks were great and we had dessert, determined to have a great Valentine’s date. But I must admit we dreaded when ever the waiter made his way to our table he was rude the entire time and often covered it with a smile or inappropriate joke. He didn’t wipe off the table in between courses. Even when dropping off a complimentary rose for the table he was sure to mention the restaurant has them do it for everyone “ it’s not really special “.  I guess I’d recommend take out you can’t go wrong with the food here, but if you want to enjoy the atmosphere and drinks cross your fingers you’re not unlucky enough to end up with waiter we had"
Restaurants for anniversary dinner,"Name: 5 North Square; Review: This was a perfect wedding anniversary dinner.  The service was fantastic, the food was amazing, and the atmosphere was authentic.  The chef here really knows what she wants the guest to experience and she makes it happen
Name: House of Siam; Review: I've been here a number of times, one of them being for an anniversary dinner, and it seriously fits all of my needs. It's classy enough that you can bring someone on a date, yet casual enough that you can head there after work when you're just hankering for some thai food. The really attentive staff and super good food will keep me coming here for a long, long time
Name: Mastro's Ocean Club; Review: We were six people celebrating an anniversary. There were no champagne flutes available. They brought over a bread basket with two rolls for six people. It was so noisy you could not speak to the person directly next to you.  The Halibut came out overcooked and when  told about it it was sent back and I was told to eat  the sides while waiting. I told the others to eat while their meals were still hot and by the time the second piece of fish arrived (not properly cooked either),everyone had finished their meals and the sides wire cold. We had to remove plates and glasses so that we had room on the table and we put them on the floor.  When the manager (Peter) was told about it he brought over a horrible bottle of dessert wine and a tray of desserts on the house. Once that was done they forgot that we were celebrating an anniversary. Peter, the manager who was on that evening was not responsive when I called and left a message several times after we left the restaurant. Boston has many fine restaurants - I would never go back and spend money at this one. They lost six good customers
Name: Lolita Back Bay; Review: My girlfriend and I came here for our 5th anniversary, an we were not disappointed in the slightest. Lengthy review ahead, because I truly enjoyed my experience here.  When I made the reservation, I noted that it was our anniversary and that, if possible, I'd like to have flowers waiting at the table ahead of time. As it turns out, the tables have flowers (real roses, too) by default. Along with beautiful silverware and plates. We were sat and our server wished us a happy anniversary, which I did not expect; so that was quite a nice little touch.  The meal began with a complementary grapefruit-tequila palette cleanser, which was very nice and unexpected. The shot of tequila that went in it was free as well! I thought this may have been a perk of it being our anniversary, but it turns out that every table gets this as well!  We split a pitcher of the Diablo margarita, which was the perfect blend of spicy, sweet, and tequila-y; I definitely recommend. We were each able to have several glasses of it, making it quite a fair price. The glasses were rimmed a lightly spiced sugar, along with lime and pepper slices.  Chips and salsa/dip are also complimentary here. The chips, seemingly homemade, were great; not too salty, not oily at all. The salsas/dip were a delicious spicy verde salsa, a nice, mild, tomato-y dip and some kind of chipotle aioli thing (I'm not a fan of sour cream/mayo based dips, so I didn't try it so I don't know actually know what it was). The verde was to die for, though!  We each got an app. She ordered the Guac Fresca, which she said was the creamiest, most amazing guac she's ever had. I ordered the empanadas, which were great. They were certainly nothing too unique, but were very well done and I enjoyed them for sure.  As for mains, I ordered the Carne Asada and she the Cauliflower Tacos. My steak, while rather small, was impeccable. Perfectly tendered, subtly charred, and oh so flavorful. I was initially disappointed by the size, but it more than made up for it in flavor and texture. The cauliflower tacos were amazing, as well. They managed to pack lots of different flavors and textures into these tacos, but nothing overpowered the other. Also, the cauliflower was fried to perfection with a nice thing, crunchy coating. The cauliflower in those tacos could be made into an app by itself.  We decided not to order dessert, as we had things waiting for us at home (and we were pretty stuffed), but we received yet ANOTHER complementary item, sour-apple cotton candy. Every table received this after their meal, but in ours, they stuck three beautiful roses into it, yet another unexpected, lovely detail. I didn't specifically ask for this, so they took it upon themselves to do this for us.  As for the restaurant itself, it's really something unique. The setting is ultra-gothic, quite dark, and definitely not something you see in a restaurant. The gothic theme did give it a certain romance, but that was diluted somewhat by the volume of the crowd and the London-bar-esque music. Ultimately we could have chosen a more romantic setting for our anniversary, but this was certainly an amazing experience and I regret nothing.  Oh and our server was very courteous and very prompt, but never pushy. A+ to her.  Come here with friends, family, a loved one, or by yourself and grab a drink at the bar. It's a very interesting, unique location perfect for a night out. It's not exactly kid or elderly friendly, so keep that in mind
Name: Gaslight; Review: We come here for our anniversary, and the service we receive is enough to keep us coming back every year.  I just add a little note notifying them of the occasion, and the entire staff seemed to know (in a positive way).  What blew my mind was when we arrived, without a word to the bartender, they directed us to the bar to wait for our table.  The bartender already knew who we were and handed us two glasses of champagne and wished us a happy anniversary with a smile.  This really impressed me, it was so seamless.  After a short while they brought us to the table.  The waiters we have had are always some of the best I have had in Boston, although we admittedly do not dine out like this very often.  The food is always amazing.  French onion soup split for 2 is the way to go every time.  In recent times we have had the steak, the duck, and the mussles.  All were fantastic.  Sitting outside on a nice evening is wonderful as well, as long as it is decently warm.  (they do have heaters!)  This is a great spot for a special occasion!!","Name: Gaslight; Review: We come here for our anniversary, and the service we receive is enough to keep us coming back every year.

Name: Orfano; Review: Visited for my anniversary this weekend, at the recommendation of a friend.  Everything about this restaurant is stellar. The decor was sleek and intimate, the service was fantastic, and the food was exquisite.  Started with the mozzarella and garlic bread, followed by the cacio e pepe and pasta with squash. Main entree was lamb and lasagna. Finished up with the gelato and chocolate cake.  Everything was cooked to perfection; the handmade pasta and olive oil and salt vanilla gelato were standouts in my opinion. Pasta portions are small, so you will need to order a main to accompany them.  Smaller wine menu, but what they offer is high quality and you should be able to find something that suits you. They offered a great recommendation for my meal that I was very satisfied with.  Service was prompt and attentive. We were never wanting for anything, and left completely satisfied.  Not insanely expensive for what it is; a perfect bit of a splurge for a special event
Name: Outlook Kitchen; Review: Ayana, Josh and Tatiana You guys made it sure we have time of our life, thank you. It was supposed to be a just an anniversary celebration but you guys turned into the lifetime memory for us, at the same time it became the reminder how wonderful the world is. You guys sure added happiness to our special day. From that one phone call to the reservation at rooftop as guests our evening got better and better. Our server was awesome do was the bartender, thank you (Merissa and Charese) Charese crafted something special for me because I didn’t feel like drinking anything from menu. the view, the ambiance was amazing and we had wonderful time at the rooftop. The dinner fulfilled the expectation, it was one of the best steak we ever had. The dessert made sure we go home satisfied and happy. It was our anniversary but you made us feel that you celebrated for us. The memory will always remain special. My husband joked that if 24 feel like this, now the bar is so high for 25th. Thank you, Tatiana, for coming out to meet us. Josh, you have awesome staff and I cannot wait to come back with my friends soon. - Jay
Name: Smith & Wollensky; Review: PROS: - EXCELLENT customer service! Made reservations for our 2nd anniversary dinner months ago. Seated quickly (Monday night, so could be because it was slow), and manager was willing to relocate us to one of the more beautiful dining rooms upon request (see CONS/Pro-tip below for more info). A timeless room, filled with history. Greeted with 2 glasses of complimentary champagne to congratulate us for our anniversary, which was a very thoughtful touch. Our waitress, Rudy, was knowledgeable about the castle and entertained us with facts about the Library Room (see pro-tip below) while we enjoyed our meal. - Great, extensive wine and drink list. - Food was SUPERB--I ordered the gorgonzola encrusted steak (applewood smoked bacon, scallions) and my husband ordered 2 bacon-wrapped steak medallions. We shared a lemon-asparagus appetizer. The steaks were FANTASTICALLY juicy, full of flavor, and the high-quality steak knives cut through with minimal effort. The asparagus was cooked to perfection. We finished with their 10-layer chocolate cake, which we were not able to finish by any means (who doesn't love dessert leftovers?), along with coffee. - The manager has a great dry sense of humor :)  CONS (more of a pro-tip): - We were originally seated in the ""main dining room,"" which was really just an extension of the bar/lounge. The other two 1st floor dining rooms (beautiful, historic) were closed for the night, likely because it was a slow Monday evening. Rock music was playing. Better to go on a weekend evening when the other dining rooms are open. Ask to reserve a table in ""The Library Room,"" where you can see beautiful, timeless pieces of America's history all around you as you eat--original flags from before we had 50 states, original hand-painted map of Boston, engraved crown molding with Generals from U.S. battles dating back to 1776!  Pro-tip TD;LR: Worth going regardless of day/time if you want to just enjoy a casual night of steaks, but only go on weekends when they are busy if you want to enjoy a fancier, or more history-filled dinner
Name: Coach Grill; Review: lovely restaurant for special occasions or when you want to get maybe a little bit dressed up. They have steaks and seafood and I believe possibly lamb. Food was delicious but some items were expensive the steak was expensive and it was just the steak no sides came with it. Side dishes which are good enough to share with least one other person sometimes they don't tell you that and so you end up with a lot of leftovers for the appetizers. Butterscotch bread pudding was very good the lemon sorbet was actually lemon sherbert but still was refreshing after a nice meal and the service was very good they were very attentive. it is a very nice atmosphere. It's not a chain restaurant so you get the feeling of it being a little bit more romantic get a little bit dressed up so you can have a nice evening out","Name: Gaslight; Review: We come here for our anniversary, and the service we receive is enough to keep us coming back every year.

Name: Deuxave; Review: Went for our wedding anniversary.  We were promptly seated at what seemed an especially nice table for 2 with large wingback chairs.  Alas, these big comfy chairs aren’t so well suited to eating; we had to sit up on the edges to eat.  Nothing came to the table for a bit, but then a friendly waiter greeted us with ""welcome back.""  (Did someone really track that we had eaten there a few years ago?).  We ordered drinks, and our meal.  We were seated a full 45 minutes before our first course came. My wife loved her foie gras; my burrata was a somewhat odd presentation; it was submerged in ""tomato water,"" something not mentioned on the menu, and making it something of a cold soup.  I wouldn’t get it again.  Main courses arrived promptly after that, but our waiter forgot that I had suggested we might like a glass of wine with dinner.  Indeed, where was our waiter?  I asked the server to bring back the wine list; the wines actually arrived when we were a third through our main courses.  My wife’s salmon was terrific; it was very lightly cooked, and she couldn’t finish it, even with help from me.  My rib-eye steak was cooked perfectly, and it was tasty, but didn’t look the least bit like a rib-eye.  It looked like a large cube of sirloin, with little, if any, marbling.  We got dessert menus, and then, we lost our waiter again.  We had to grab the roving hostess to get him to return to the table.  The Dark Chocolate Crèmeux was a memorable dessert.  Great chocolate, and lots of different textures.  As others have noted, this is not an inexpensive restaurant, and while it had several big pluses, the more-than-occasional lapses in service and presentation weren’t up to this high a price tag","Name: 5 North Square; Review: This was a perfect wedding anniversary dinner.  The service was fantastic, the food was amazing, and the atmosphere was authentic.  The chef here really knows what she wants the guest to experience and she makes it happen

Name: Mastro's Ocean Club; Review: My husband made reservations for the two of us on my birthday via OpenTable. The ambiance and restaurant itself was beautiful. We went on a Sunday night on the evening of my birthday. The cocktail list was impressive and the drinks were awesome! The food..not so much. Maybe it was a mistake ordering seafood at a steakhouse but my halibut came out dry as a bone. They offer pan seared, grilled or baked. I figured panseared would be the best option for keeping the fish moist and flavorful. Boy was I wrong! It appeared like they baked it from the looks of it. My husband ordered 8oz filet medium rare. It came out medium well. The sides were good and our app of tuna tartare was good too. We didn't  complain since it was my birthday but thinking back, for the money he spent on the meal, I wouldn't dare eat there again. Maybe just come back for the drinks

Name: Smith & Wollensky; Review: PROS: - EXCELLENT customer service! Made reservations for our 2nd anniversary dinner months ago. Seated quickly (Monday night, so could be because it was slow), and manager was willing to relocate us to one of the more beautiful dining rooms upon request (see CONS/Pro-tip below for more info). A timeless room, filled with history. Greeted with 2 glasses of complimentary champagne to congratulate us for our anniversary, which was a very thoughtful touch. Our waitress, Rudy, was knowledgeable about the castle and entertained us with facts about the Library Room (see pro-tip below) while we enjoyed our meal. - Great, extensive wine and drink list. - Food was SUPERB--I ordered the gorgonzola encrusted steak (applewood smoked bacon, scallions) and my husband ordered 2 bacon-wrapped steak medallions. We shared a lemon-asparagus appetizer. The steaks were FANTASTICALLY juicy, full of flavor, and the high-quality steak knives cut through with minimal effort. The asparagus was cooked to perfection. We finished with their 10-layer chocolate cake, which we were not able to finish by any means (who doesn't love dessert leftovers?), along with coffee. - The manager has a great dry sense of humor :)  CONS (more of a pro-tip): - We were originally seated in the ""main dining room,"" which was really just an extension of the bar/lounge. The other two 1st floor dining rooms (beautiful, historic) were closed for the night, likely because it was a slow Monday evening. Rock music was playing.

Name: Piccolo Nido; Review: After having a  few pleasant dinners at Piccolo Nido, we decided to celebrate our daughter's engagement there. It was one of the worst and most embarrassing dinners we have ever had at a restaurant. We had reservations and arrived on time, we were one of the first parties there. As the restaurant filled with patrons the service, at our table of 10, the wait staff became less and less attentive. EVERYONE at the restaurant was served their dinner before us. We waited 2 hours before our dinner was served. When I asked why everyone else was already served, the owner, Pino, came to the table and in a very rude way (so that everyone could hear) said that they don't usually accomodate parties of 10, (then why did they take a reservation for a party of 10?) and that there were people with children who had come in after us, (so were we to wait because people come in with kids, not my problem!) so naturally they would be served first. We will NEVER return to Piccolo Nido again. Worst dining experience ever! Food was average by the way. Much better restaurants in the North End

Name: Gaslight; Review: We come here for our anniversary, and the service we receive is enough to keep us coming back every year.  I just add a little note notifying them of the occasion, and the entire staff seemed to know (in a positive way).  What blew my mind was when we arrived, without a word to the bartender, they directed us to the bar to wait for our table.  The bartender already knew who we were and handed us two glasses of champagne and wished us a happy anniversary with a smile.  This really impressed me, it was so seamless.  After a short while they brought us to the table.  The waiters we have had are always some of the best I have had in Boston, although we admittedly do not dine out like this very often.  The food is always amazing.  French onion soup split for 2 is the way to go every time.  In recent times we have had the steak, the duck, and the mussles.  All were fantastic.  Sitting outside on a nice evening is wonderful as well, as long as it is decently warm.  (they do have heaters!)  This is a great spot for a special occasion!!"
Where should I eat with a big group of friends?,"Name: Pushcart Cafe & Pizzaria; Review: Stopped in with a group of friends for wine, due to the  bar being open and we were waiting for our table to be ready across the street. The big bartender was an jerk right away. As we sat he proceeded give our group a hard time and call us names in Italian, including racial insults. Little did he know that one of our group spoke Italian and called him out on it. We decided to leave and asked for the check, he placed the check far from my reach so when I went to grab it I accidentally tipped my glass. I was able to catch my glass there was a small spill. As I tried to clean it up with my napkin he swatted my hand away and took my unfinished glass of wine. I apologized for the accident with, I am sorry to only be told in return not as sorry as he was. No pizza or wine is worth this rude behavior. especially with other pizza shops down the road
Name: Kung Fu Tea; Review: UPDATE : my friends drinks were all made incorrectly and they had ordered some to go and still messed it up. Worst experience we travel an hour away to this place. Never going back.  Me and my small group of friends visited this place, and we asked if they were closed and the employee said no. (We asked because they were closing in a few minutes) so I’m the last person in line to put in my order and he says he can’t take my order because it was already 11 so they’re technically “closed”. My friends ordered their drinks and I was left with nothing. We should’ve asked for a refund and left, but I was so annoyed I couldn’t think. If I could give no stars as a review I would. First time there and never going back.  I’m seriously frustrated and I want to contact cooperate
Name: Audubon; Review: This is a shout out mostly to Jay, the host, and the fantastic waitstaff we had a few nights ago. The food's also great, of course, but we had nine people on a group outing during a freezing night, which is asking a bit much of such a cozy (small) place.  No reservations allowed, but we were on the wait list. Unfortunately, horrible traffic for a local event (ski jumping inside Fenway Park of all things) delayed most of the group well beyond the time Jay could reasonably hold our tables. He would have been completely right to send us on our way, but instead, when a sizable group deserted the long, thin high top table separating the entry from the bar, he sat those of us who had arrived and reserved the rest of the space for our group.  Thanks again for helping salvage our evening
Name: Dillon's; Review: TL;DR Awful, disrespectful service. Called ahead to secure a space for a large group and we were ignored, treated like a nuisance, and basically made clear we were not wanted. None of us are going back.  Full (Long) Story I work at a store nearby of about 250 employees. We will occasionally have gatherings at local spots to celebrate birthdays, promotions, just general fun.  A friend was having a birthday and called about a week ahead to see if DIllons could accommodate a large-ish group of about 30, with folks coming and going throughout the night. She tried to book the place for a Friday night, so she knew it may be busy and wanted to make sure this could work. They said this was fine.  When my group arrived after our shift, a few folks had already shown up early. They got a table on the patio but when we tried to join them, they warned us that they had been told we’d all get thrown out of too many of us tried to sit on the patio.  So the rest of us decide to go to the bar. Their front bar is not super large, so this ended up being a disaster and it took close to 20 minutes for the first of us to get a drink. By this point the birthday girl showed up and was trying to secure us a space.  They decided to stick us on these tables towards the back; not the back room but rather ones that line the hall to get to the back. The tables could fit maybe 8 people comfortably and anybody standing was blocking the hall to get to the back.  Another group had been giving that room. We were told if we wanted table service one person would have to put down a credit card to assure payment. With us expecting upwards of 50 people coming and going through the night, we obviously weren’t going to do that, but we were not getting service at the bar.  Once the group who had the back space showed up, it was a miserable, cramped mess. It was obvious the staff didn’t want us there. I ended up leaving, having never gotten a drink.  After the fact the rest of our group left and went to another spot nearby who’s always accommodated us happily, knew us well and had no issue with the large, transient group.  Needless to say, never going back, and our staff of 250+ people all heard about how we were treated and take their business elsewhere as well
Name: Mariel; Review: If able, I wouldn't even give them that 1 star, they deserve 0. Yes, I do not write many reviews, thats because most restaurants I eat at are consistently good, so I never felt the need to review. But this place I couldn't not share this experience. This place just opened, they should've saved the money spent on cheesy chandeliers and decor and bought some decent food to serve(since at the end of the day people come to EAT) and a better, much more professional staff, from the manager down. Or just made it a Taco Bell, which serves better food and even provides better service. We were celebrating my wife's 40th birthday with 3 couples, SIX PEOPLE,  three course meal, so we obviously ordered SEVERAL appetizers, 6 entrees and 6 deserts, making this an accurate variety of menu review. One word: HORRIBLE!! I actually felt so bad that this was my suggestion since it was new, obviously none of our group had ever been and my wife loves trying new restaurants throughout Boston. I saw it just opened and all their advertising, so I thought it would be a nice surprise just like by inviting her 2 best friends and their husbands to join us. How bad did I feel?? Bad enough that the following Sat night I took the same group (all SIX OF US) out to a good restaurant for the experience my wife deserved originally. Not to mention it cost me 2 group dinners! Literally not ONE person left Mariel ever wanting to return. We were all VERY DISAPPOINTED. Tiny portions of sub par food, more like half orders at other places. It was a mostly bare plate. I didn't take pics but noticed others had, so you can see for yourself","Name: Happy's Bar & Kitchen; Review: Came here for a pregame meet up of 8 friends. We were seated promptly. There was a long delay between the point we were ready to order and the point the waitress came to take our orders. Everyone said they enjoyed their plentiful meals, and they were quick to respond with extras we requested. We agreed we would eat here again
Name: The Social Register; Review: High prices, small portions, and ok food. I visited with a group of 4. The menu suggested that patrons order with the intent to share each dish. We decided to follow the suggestion and each ordered a different item. When the food finally arrived (service was very slow this night, though the table clearing girls were extremely fastidious), we were very disappointed to find that the portions were more suited for 1-2 people. Even more boggling was that dishes were divided into 3 or 5 pieces, clearly the perfect choice for a 'shareable' dish. If this was called out in the menu we would have known and not ordered. For example, the shareable Caeser salad was served in a bowl the size of a normal cereal bowl, thus not nearly enough. If my group was 1 or 2 people, such as a date, 4 dishes would have been enough to satisfy us. With 4 people, 4 dishes just didn't cut it. We found out later by watching other patrons, that ordering burgers or sandwiches was the way to go. Those dishes came out on large plates with heaping helpings of fries along with a large burger. All that for about the same price as any one of the tiny dishes we ordered! Unfortunately we had already spent over $60 on our tiny plates and decided to cut our losses and leave. The server could tell we were unsatisfied with the meal and apologized. We told her that it was mostly the tiny amount of food that made us upset, but the slow service didn't help. The atmosphere was loud and for some reason everything was brass colored. It almost looked like they were going for a steampunk vibe but forgot all the interesting machinery bits. Very blah and dark. So to sum this up, get a burger here if you want a decent amount of food. If you would rather waste your money on small amounts of mediocre food then get the 'social' dishes
Name: Cafeteria Boston; Review: Cafeteria Boston is one of my favorite restaurants in the city. And just like any other restaurant that I love, I've dined here several times and they NEVER disappoint.  The last time I went here was in late August with three friends. The weather was gorgeous, sunny and warm, versus hot and humid so of course we sat on the patio. Since it was early evening (sometime between 4 and 5pm)  the patio was mostly empty around that time. Upon arrival, it was only myself and my friend that drove us, so we were waiting on our two other friends. Although everyone arrived at different intervals in time, our server was still prompt and checked in with us regularly.  I'm the definition of a social drinker so I ordered one fruity cocktail, the pomegranate martini; then I had the chicken drumsticks with celery and carrot sticks (ALL the sticks) as an appetizer. Soon after our other two friends arrived and so did the rest of Boston as the patio started to fill up quickly.  I was having such a great time catching up with everyone I didn't even notice if there was a lapse between our drinks and food as we dined for several hours. I got the black bean burger as my entree and devoured it and everyone else was super happy with their entree choices as well.  The food and service here are always good will definitely be back soon
Name: Marlborough Super Buffet; Review: I must say that this is a fun place for a group of people. The food at this place is consistently pretty okay. The food is best around the noon lunch rush and the 6-7pm dinner rush as the options are refreshed regularly.  There are a ton of options to choose from. As with typical Americanized Asian food offerings, you'll find the standard options like spare ribs, chicken with broccoli, rice options, and chicken fingers plus wontons, soup, crawfish and more. Additionally, the dinner menu comes with an option for the hand made sushi that's pretty good!  They're are also options for the fussy eating underage crowd: chicken tenders, pizza, french fries and the like.  It's not fine dining, but it's a great place for a good meal
Name: Belly Buster Diner; Review: Came here yesterday with my daughter and a friend, it was our first time and I've heard great things about this place. The food is amazing!!

Highest recommendation, this place needs to get on the map

Name: Flames Restaurant II; Review: Flames is very good. Almost a homely and comfortable feel. Food is varied, generous, ..and absolutely delicious!! Great oxtail, goat meat, jerk, fish steaks. Oh yes, the beef patty, a must try. The cod fritter is great too. Get the rice with beans, and sure, for sure, the cabbage and carrots! And the jerk wings?!!! God, where do I stop?!!  When you walk through the door u see that they were Zagat rated. When the food is in your mouth , you will know that they deserve.  Good food in that neighborhood is mostly subs and pizzas. In the midst of that, they are heaven.  Only, they are a little fussy about 'dine in'. You have to make up your mind, are you ""taking out"" or dining in? They look more like a deli, but don't like you buying a box and sit down to eat from it, if you felt like! So if you want to dine in, please sit down and wait to be table service :). By the way, they stop dine in at least 30min before the restaurant closing, while you can continue to buy carry out

Name: Barracuda on the Fly; Review: Friendly staff at clean location with ~20ppl worth of seating. Friendly for locals and youth. If you work near the location you can get 10% off. If you have college you can get 10% off. You can order online for pick up. Not for a long stay as it seems that they do not have a bathroom for customer. Good spot for quick lunch

Name: Ocean Prime; Review: If you are looking for fine dining in downtown Boston, this is definitely the place, chain or no chain. This is going to give Grill 23, Capital Grille and Ruth Chris Steak House a run for their money, which the latter two are chains as well. First off, the location absolutely hits the mark and is in the center of the action. This sits in a central spot directly at the beginning of the seaport district. The valet parking is a bit tight seeing this is a busy street, however they are quick on their feet and even send you an automated text when the car is being delivered.  The interior of this place is quite large and you would never know it from the street. The bar area is beautiful and the whole place is elegantly decorated and looks really cool and trendy. The bar serves up some creative cocktails, even a really cool berry concoction with dry ice that tasted excellent. We got their a bit early and our Saturday reservation was not until 8:30pm so we sat in the bar. The place was very crowded and the hostess station was a bit disorganized. We did not get seated until around 8:45pm since they were waiting on tables to clear but with 3 hostesses, thats how busy this place was on Saturday night.  We were seated in a back room area which was nicely secluded and the main dining room is split up into multiple rooms. The staff here is so good, they attend to you right away and are there throughout every step of the meal which was nice. The menu is large with not only more cocktails, appetizers, sushi, seafood and of course steak done many different ways. We opted for appetizers of goat cheese ravioli, deviled eggs with caviar and steak tartar which all were incredible. The goat cheese ravioli melted in your mouth. For entrees, we ordered filets, scallops and a surf and turf with sides of smoked gouda tater tots (just delicious) and some sautéed brussel sprouts. Every bite was tender, cooked to perfection and tasted beautiful. I have eaten at Capital Grille many times as well as Abe and Louies and this steak blew them out of the water.  For dessert we were about to order when an older gentleman from another table came over and told us we were being too loud which was probably one of the rudest things that could happen during a night out, of which we let him know before he left. Our waiter overheard the exchange and offered up free dessert of a 10 layer carrot cake (yes 10), chocolate covered peanut butter cake and a brownie batter ice cream which again all hit the spot, delicious. This meal was very good and I would highly recommend this place. Prices are what you would expect for fine dining and it was worth every penny

Name: Real Deal, LLC; Review: Covid helpful info: parallel street parking, no meters. Most times of the day you can find a spot near this location. Once you walk into the joint you will go to the cashier to get your food. They have 2-3 tables inside but not sure if you can dine in there. No tables to dine out, it is mostly a location people do take out or delivery from.  This location is a local favorite for me. I used to live near the Cleveland Circle location, hang out with friends near the JP one, and now I live by the West Roxbury location and I love them all equally. Their food is consistent and they are always quick. My favorite app that I get almost every time is their onion rings because they are really yummy but I am a big fan of sauces and their kickin bayou sauce is delicious! The sauce is like a sriracha, Mayo, and other yummy things (real deal sorry if I’m wrong with those ingredients!) Meals I typically get are the Joe Spa (chicken Caesar wrap), Reuben, grown up grilled cheese, any burger, and any pizza. Definitely would recommend going to any of their locations"
Give me some family-friendly restaurants,"Name: Roza Lyons; Review: Great place to bring the family for a meal or a couple friends for drinks.  The staff is very friendly and accommodating.   The menu is diverse so there is something for everyone and they have several weekly specials so it doesn't get boring.  We mostly enjoy the friendly atmosphere
Name: Tipico Dominicano; Review: Great place, the food was amazing and they are very friendly
Name: Tony C’s Seaport; Review: If I could give 0 stars I would. We were staying in the hotel right next door and were looking for a family friendly restaurants as we had three kids with us. There was nobody waiting outside so we thought we would get right in. We walked in, the host took a second to look around (at the plenty of empty tables) and then told us there were 3 or 4 groups ahead of us and there would be a wait. I asked about how long, and he couldn’t give me an answer, just 3 or 4 groups. Don’t you know as a host how many people are waiting? I feel they did not want the children in there and it was very unprofessional and we felt unwelcome. We ended up at the restaurant right across the way and witnessed several people walk in and be seated immediately the entire time we were dining. Would definitely not recommend!! Don’t say you are a family friendly restaurant when you steer families away
Name: Fenway Johnnies; Review: OPEN:  That's a keyword these days, as restaurants try to re-coup from the pandemic. HIGHLY RECOMMEND Fenway Johnnie's - it re-opened this week - after 4 months shuttered - and I couldn't wait to get back. I always feel welcomed here.  LOCATION: Only steps from Fenway Park, here you can get real food before or after a Red Sox Game. Great lounge atmosphere plus bar seating with some good seating in the additional dining room. Lots of big TVs, sports posters and artwork surround the rooms. Not just bar food, but a choice of entrees make Johnnie's a little different, and a little better than neighboring restaurants.  FOOD: Probably the best tasting salmon dinner I have had in a long while.  Preparation is key, and this entree was done right - not hard or over-cooked - this Pan seared salmon came with Lyonnaise potatoes, and green beans served with a great lemon beurre-blanc sauce. Delicious!  DRINKS:  Best beer and liquor selection - a full bar - with bartenders who know how to make a great cocktail. Igor and Dana stand out.  FAMILY:  Johnnie's is large enough to bring your family or friends for a get-together near Fenway Park. The tables are big, with enough room for everyone. Best yet, you will always be treated like family here  - from  the Johnnie's  family. Treat yourself and family to some of the best restaurant service in Boston - friendly, professional and sharp. As I keep saying: ""I love it here""
Name: Barney's Grill; Review: Rude rude and more rude. Owner or manager whatever he is doesn't know the first thing about customer service. This man treated my family bad. Stay away. Plenty of other great restaurants around","Name: 99 Restaurants; Review: My favorite restaurant is the 99. I like to go there because they have good food and delicious drinks. They also have great service for people who come to the restaurant. Lastly, the seating area where you eat is entertaining and comfortable.  I like the 99 because they have great food.I love their ribs because they are juicy and tender. The macaroni and cheese is delightful. It is always hot and cheesy. Are you a big baseball fan? If so, when the Red Sox win kids eat for free. Great news grown ups, you don't have to pay  They have drinks that no one can live without. The pink lemonade is awesome. It is really refreshing to drink. You can get as many free refills as you want. You can also ask for a different drink.  They even have root beer that taste like icecream. With so many options, you won't have a problem finding a drink that you like.  The waitresses are nice and give good service. Before you order they give you popcorn. If you are very hungry then eat some popcorn,  but warning do not spoil your dinner. They bring out the food fast and make sure you have everything you need at the table. At the end, they give the kids an ice cream sandwich.  Lastly, I like the 99 because of the seating area the chairs are comfortable and fluffy. You can watch any kind of sports games. They have Celtics Pictures on the the wall. If you get bored then watch tv and eat more popcorn.  I hope you visit the 99 and experience the food and drinks, the service,  and the seating area that I love about the restaurant.

Name: Stelio's Family Restaurant; Review: Been driving by this place for years, but always had a doubt because the mixed reviews. Finally gave it a try as part of our try something new in the area. We went for lunch on Saturday at 12:30. The parking lot is full as there was a baby shower going on in the function room. It pretty decent American style with a good mix of classic and new dishes. We ordered veritirs of dishes, Fish Chowder, BBQ Ribs, Baked Haddock , Roasted Lamb, for us, and pasta and chicken fingers for kids. The chowder had a hearty taste, good for a cold day. The ribs were St Louis style, fall of the bone tender. The baked haddock was very tender, the light touch of butter made the fish very smooth. The baked lamb is tomato based, it could use a kick of flavor. Kids meals are large potion and pretty standard. Overall, pretty nice place, would come again. The inside of the restaurant was renovated last year compare to some old photos. It has a bit of modern touch now
Name: Family Affair Restaurant; Review: I work at Northeastern University and the food for an event that I was attending was catered by family affair. I promise you all 50 of us raved about the food! Fried chicken sooo good! Mac and cheese sooo good! BBQ pulled pork, bomb too! Oh and the jerk chicken was yummy too! The food your restaurant provided was exceptional! Looking forward to visiting the restaurant on my own
Name: Family Affair Restaurant; Review: I’m always in the lookup you try new restaurant. I walked into the restaurant and the smell of the food was amazing. I was greeted by the owner and I ordered the oxtail dinner. The meat was so tender and full of flavor and the mashed potatoes and Mac and cheese were delicious. The owner walked to my table and offer me a free lemonade drink. A must try restaurant. A Must try food
Name: Tony C’s Seaport; Review: If I could give 0 stars I would. We were staying in the hotel right next door and were looking for a family friendly restaurants as we had three kids with us. There was nobody waiting outside so we thought we would get right in. We walked in, the host took a second to look around (at the plenty of empty tables) and then told us there were 3 or 4 groups ahead of us and there would be a wait. I asked about how long, and he couldn’t give me an answer, just 3 or 4 groups. Don’t you know as a host how many people are waiting? I feel they did not want the children in there and it was very unprofessional and we felt unwelcome. We ended up at the restaurant right across the way and witnessed several people walk in and be seated immediately the entire time we were dining. Would definitely not recommend!! Don’t say you are a family friendly restaurant when you steer families away","Name: Family Affair Restaurant; Review: I work at Northeastern University and the food for an event that I was attending was catered by family affair.

Name: Little Asia Restaurant; Review: The place is great for a family or if you just need a quick bite and a beer. Their food is always a top go to but a secret weapon of theirs is the chinese pizza. I'm not sure it's on their online menu but just ask, they're awesome. The staff has always been very friendly, they get to know you quick and treat you like you've been going forever. Now with Covid they have barriers between tables and seem to be taking the situation seriously. They have a bar area and a variety of drinks (man's mai tai is always my go to), keno if you want to kill time while waiting. Would definitely suggest trying if you haven'

Name: Sportello; Review: CHILD FRIENDLY! Can't say enough about this place.  Hadn't been in a couple years and wasn't sure what to expect. My 3yr old was tantruming as we walked in and multiple staff immediately came over to offer bread, suggest firing a child's pasta dish, and bring a coloring book with crayons. Server mentioned dessert without saying the word and told me I didn't need to apologize for my son.  And when I asked for an espresso before leaving it arrived within a 2 minutes. Arguably best service I've ever had.  The food was awesome.  Octopus carpaccio was inventive and delicious (and portion was almost a meal in itself). The shrimp and corn cappaletti was good and creative,  although I didn't love that the filling was a mousse. Dish was well executed though.  My son's tagliatelle with butter was beautiful. Tagliatelle was so delicate and the butter was more of a butter emulsion

Name: Roza Lyons; Review: Great place to bring the family for a meal or a couple friends for drinks.  The staff is very friendly and accommodating.   The menu is diverse so there is something for everyone and they have several weekly specials so it doesn't get boring.  We mostly enjoy the friendly atmosphere","Name: Liberty Diner; Review: Absolutely the atmosphere I was looking for. Very local, multicultural feel. The menu was exactly what you would expect from a local dinner, and the food was excellent. I went simple and got a cheeseburger and fries, but the burger was delicious, and the fries weren't greasy. The cost for my entire meal and tip was $12. I'd absolutely recommend this place for a comfortable, quick, familiar bite to eat

Name: FiRE+iCE; Review: Be prepared for the amazing Fire and Ice in Back Bay which is very close to shopping stores. My favorite food is the Alfredo spaghetti with shrimp. I think you might like it as much as I do. You should try it and you might like it to because you don't have to go that far from the shopping stores. I love the music they play because it's calm and fun music that a lot of people know.  The set up is so good. There are two floors. On the first floor there's a bar for adults. On the second floor there's all the food. If you want to go to a buffet you can go to Fire+Ice because you get the food exactly like you are in a buffet. The food is all set up. You get the food you want. The only difference about is that the food is frozen. There is a table in the middle where you can watch them cook it. It only takes a few minutes or seconds for them to cook it for you. If you want you can bring 15 people with you because there are big tables. There are a lot of tables on the second floor. The chefs don't have any kitchens they have a cooking table in the middle of the second floor. You can even watch your food be cooked and other people's food be cooked as well. On the second floor there are decorations on the ceiling made out of wood. They look like anything you would put in a burger, like cheese, buns, ketchup, salad, tomatoes, and anything you could expect to put in a burger. My favorite is the cheese because they made it like the cheese with the holes in it. They are perfectly cut out. The view is pretty cool that you can see the park across the street. You can see the entrance to the park and the playground. The view at night is really cool because the lights are really bright and you can see the park much better.  The food is so good. Like I said the Alfredo spaghetti with shrimp in it is my favorite. The reason why I like the Alfredo spaghetti is because the sweetness of the Alfredo is so good. With normal sauce it makes the spaghetti taste dry which is my opinion. To me sometimes, with tomato sauce, it tastes kind of dry. But, with alfredo sauce, since it tastes so sweet, it's like it is blowing my mouth up. They also have an ice cream bar, chinese food, veggies, salsa bar, rice, seafood and fruit. The ice cream bar has so many kinds of toppings. The toppings are oreos, m and ms, chocolate chips, hot fuge, and resies pesies. When I walk in the restaurant I smell all the food that is being cooked at once. When you eat the food it's not to cold, hot, or burnt. It is perfectly made. The Chinese food they have is the rice, chicken and veggie rice. A way to know you like the food is if you get very messy. Usually when people like the food, the get more and more plates. When I got more plates, I get very full and my face is covered with Alfredo sauce and spaghetti.  If you live in Boston then you will be able to go to Fire+and Ice very easily. It's very close to the train station. It's in Back Bay near the orange line. It's also very close to Chinatown since Back Bay is the stop almost in the middle between Oak Grove and Forest Hills. It is about two stops away from the middle. When you exit Fire and Ice, around the corner there is Marshall's. There is also a little walk-in area next to Marshall's where there are shopping stores. There is also the Prudential Mall that is very close to Fire and Ice and there are lots of shopping stores there and there are lots of other restaurants and places there too.  Those are all three reasons why I think Fire+Ice is my favorite restaurant ever. Whenever you go to Fire+Ice I hope you like it so much. I still have a feeling that you will like the food no matter what.  - Written by Laila, a third grader in Ms. Taryn's clas

Name: Pronti Sandwich Co.; Review: My family found new favorite eats last night! Pronti on Rte 1 is fantastic! Great menu with lots of choices, highly customizable items. Even my picky son found something to eat and enjoyed it all! The food was hot and fresh, the employees were beyond friendly and helpful. If you are looking for something a little bit different, try out Pronti. We will most certainly be back soon

Name: Wonder Spice Cafe; Review: Hi. My name is Audrey and I'm going to tell you about Wonder Spice Cafe!  Wonder Spice Cafe is the best restaurant ever! I love Wonder spice because the food is delicious, the service is great, and the location is perfect!! When you walk into Wonder Spice, you will think that you have walked into a dream. You will smell the good food cooking on the stove, and you see customers sitting at the tables, waiting patiently for their food. Everything you get is always delicious.  Wonder Spice Cafe's food is one of the best things you will ever try!! The spring rolls are really good, nice and crispy. The shumais are warm and soft. They're like swallowing a big warm hug. The golden triangles are crispy and crunchy, full of flavor. Their pad thai is the dream. It's mixed up with the most delicious shrimp and chicken I have ever tasted. Wonder Spice also has the best drinks. It has water, milk, juice, and more!  You have got to try out Wonder Spice's food!!!!!  Wonder Spice Cafe's location is just as good as their food. They have a parking lot near the restaurant, and sometimes you can get a really good parking spot in front of the restaurant. Wonder Spice Cafe is located in JP (Jamaica Plain), near JP Licks. If you do not have a car, you can take a taxi, uber, or lyft. Wonder Spice Cafe is also near Dunkin Donuts, Fresh Hair, Curtis Hall, Boing, and a playground, baseball field, CVS Pharmacy, and Noodle Barn.  Wonder Spice Cafe's service is really good, too. The waiters and waitresses are really nice. They always greet you kindly as you come in, and the chefs make your food quickly (25 - 30 min) and entertain you with drinks and appetizers.  Wonder Spice has the best food, service, and location!! You have to try out Wonder Spice Cafe!"
No spicy food,"Name: BBQ Chicken; Review: We stumbled across bb.q a few days after it opened when its menu was still half unavailable. It didn't matter. The chicken was phenomenal. GO HERE! Easily the best Korean fried chicken we've had in Boston. Incredibly cheap for the price, with generous portions at 10 pieces for ~$11. We tried their Secret Spicy and the Gang-Jeong, and both were wonderful in their own right (and perfectly cooked). But the real star came on a repeat visit when we got the Hot and Spicy (which was not on the menu the first time we went). We were hoping for spicy chicken and GOOD GOD we were rewarded. This was incredibly spicy and it didn't matter one bit. The chicken was moist and incredibly flavorful, and the sauce hit that perfect note of sweet, savory, and searingly spicy. This is really not chicken for the faint of heart, but for those feeling brave, give it a shot. It's wonderful.  Can't wait to get more from them
Name: Chicked's Chicken & Grill; Review: Very bad tasting food. I asked for nothing spicy and the woman said it wasn't spicy and that the chicken sandwich comes with mayo,lettuce and tomato. I asked for no tomato. I waited a  30 mins to get a sandwich with hot sauce on i
Name: Hot Eastern; Review: The service was superb! The server was very nice and gave me the menu with lots of pictures. I ordered a seafood mala bang that was moderately spicy. It was just right. I can eat pretty spicy and I think their spicy scale is appropriate (unlike some Thai restaurants...You order a mild spicy dish and next thing you know you turn into a dragon blowing up flames.) The dumplings appetizer was also good.   I gave this place a four stars because I had a sense that the food is not entirely authentic. I came all the way from San Diego and this place was advertised as Szechuan authentic restaurant. I would appreciate if the menu would indicate which dishes are particularly *authentic*. :
Name: Sichuan Gourmet Billerica; Review: Best Restaurant in Billerica. You might at first be thrown off by this tiny restaurant's appearance, crammed in a tiny strip mall with a liquor store and a laundromat, but don't let that fool you. Sichuan Gourmet has, hands down, the best food in Billerica, and for Chinese food beats any of the Chinatown places I've been to. The trick is to not order typical ""American"" Chinese dishes like Beef and Broccoli or Sweet and Sour Chicken, which are not very good here, -- the dishes you've never heard of are going to be the best.  I should at this point mention that because the cuisine is from the Sichuan region, much of their food is spicy. Unlike many places, when they put those pepper symbols on the menu, they mean it. However, the spiciness is never a raw overpowering burning -- they dishes carefully balance ""Ma"" (a tingly, electric sensation), ""La"" (spicy), and ""Tang"" (a hot burning sensation) with sweet and savory flavors that can convert many people who think they hate spicy food. They aren't just adding cayenne to their dishes like so many other places do. They also have plenty of non-spicy dishes, and are happy to make any of their menu items less spicy.  For spicy dishes, my favorites are the ""Pork and Eggplant with Yu Xiang Sauce"" which appears on their separate specials menu (it has perfect balance of spicy sauce, sweet eggplant, and savory pork), the Dan Dan Noodles (which the waiter should warn you need to be mixed before eating), any of the ""with Spicy Chili Sauce"" dishes (which are meat or fish served in a red spicy sauce with Napa Cabbage), the ""Old Sichuan Chicken"" (a dried fried chicken with an interesting crust -- the house specialty), the ""Gangou Dry Fish Filet"" (similar to the Old Sichuan Chicken but with fish), the ""Sliced Roast Beef & Tendon w. Chili Sauce"" (if you like tendon), and the ""Hot & Sour Wonton Soup"" (listed under ""Sichuan Delicacies"" not ""Soup"", and very different from a typical Americanized Hot & Sour).  For non-spicy dishes, I would recommend the Scallion Pancake (the only Americanized appetizer I would recommend here),""Sichuan Cold Noodles - none spicy"" (cold noodles in a vinegary peanut sauce), ""Sichuan Style String Beans"" (a Sichuan classic, and done very well here), ""Meat Ball Sichuan Style"" (A soup-like hot pot with huge meatballs and lots of vegetables), and the Sesame Sweet Potato Cakes (A hot soft sweet-potato pancake that is stuffed with a sweet bean paste, coated in sesame seeds, and drizzled with a sweet sauce).  This restaurant also has fancier locations in Framingham and Brookline, but the food is much better in Billerica. If you're looking for authentic or spicy food, it's worth the drive

Name: Spice & Pepper; Review: Excellent Asian cuisine in a non-descript location. Just about everything on the menu is excellent... not something I say about many places. Every time we decide to try something new, we are almost never disappointed. The food here has been consistently excellent over a considerable period of time. They are hard workers, friendly people and they provide excellent food when you are in the mood for Thai cuisine. Definitely, give them a try

Name: Mumbai Spice; Review: Not a big fan of writting negative stuff. But unfriendly staff. Like the main waitress was kind of rude may be she had a long day. Food I would say was ok. I would suggest never try lamb or goat because the meat is never tender this is my second experience. I ordered a goat biryani. There were tiny tiny bones so it was really uncomfortable to eat, I ate just two spoons and gave up, well goat and lamb is with bones but tiny bones are really risky if you swallow you might get choked. Biryani was I would say atleast a week old ( easily figures out with the taste and size of the rice grain) was very spicy, the masala was not in proportion. Goan curry was amazing loved the taste. Nan was ok no complains. Kachori chat was also ok.  One more thing I was not sure of they already add tips which I guess was 15% and do they expect us to write more tips because below of the invoice there was suggestion for tips. Not sure. Overall I would give one more try and see if they can make some changes","Name: China Gourmet Restaurant; Review: Totally not spicy. The taste is ok, but the Hunan cuisine has been improved.

Heed the spice warnings on the menu.  Amateras ramen seems to be a popular spot for a quick bowl of ramen on those plentiful chilly Boston days. We went there around 5:45pm on a Thursday night and were seated immediately. The boiled gyoza appetizer was great - the wrappers were some of the softest ones I'd ever tasted. My 5X spicy miso ramen was flavorful. I didn't know how Amateras' spice scale compared relative to other places so I started there, but next time I will definitely be going 10x. My husband's level 2 spicy green monster was definitely the spicier of the two. The thai chiles in the clear broth definitely packed a punch.  The staff is polite, friendly, and attentive. Our waters were kept filled, table was set and cleared promptly, and our server processed our payment quickly

Name: Ghost King Thai; Review: This is such a great new spot for spicy chicken! When I went they only had a spicy version available and IT REALLY IS SPICY! They now have a no spice option if you want to taste their delicious chicken without the spicy jam.  The service was great and our food was ready for pickup the exact time we got to the restaurant. Our server was kind and we didn't wait at all.  I got two box meals with two Thai teas. The box meals come with two pieces of fried chicken, sticky rice, shrimp chips, green papaya salad. Both of the boxes were exactly the same so don't worry about consistency!  Fried Chicken: The chicken had such crazy crispy skin! After driving home for 30 minutes it was still crispy and the meat inside was juicy. The sauce on top is REALLY flavorful and I thought it went well with the other items in the box. I thought it had a nice spice which wasn't too much but left a nice heat on your tongue. If you don't like spice thought it will be wAYYYY too spicy for you so stick to the no spice option.  Sticky Rice: This tasted like normal sticky rice and was great with the chicken or the salad!  Papaya Salad: This salad had so many flavors, it was really refreshing to eat along with the chicken! Though it was waaaay too spicy for me it was perfect for my boyfriend. I thought the papaya salad was spicier than the chicken lol.  Shrimp chips: These are the normal shrimp chips you eat. I think they were really nice to eat between the salad and the chicken and I even used it like a chip to hold the salad and chicken!  [invited

Name: Mumbai Spice; Review: I am in a spree of finding the best Biriyani in Boston. And Mumbai spice is definitely up, there, in the top three! I ordered Lamb Biriyani with baby corn Manchurian and I should say my taste buds had an amazing treat!  About the biriyani:  1. The spice mix was perfect. It wasn't bland, it wasn't too spicy. It was just perfect. Some places add too much spice randomly (when you ask them to make it spicy), which ruins the flavor and your stomach. Mumbai spice had the right amount of spice. 2. The lamb was cooked perfectly. A lot of places tend to over cook lamb, but Mumbai spice got it right. 3. The portion was generous 4. The price was reasonable.  The baby corn Manchurian was awesome too. It had a nice crispness to it. Its refreshing to see different items instead of the regular paneer/ chicken Manchurians. Kudos and would definitely recommend this place

Also, the tip wasn't added when I used my card until I added it, so I don't know what that review was about. It seemed pretty authentic to me. I had the tonkatsu ramen with a few add-ons. I was disappointed there wasn't a spicy option, but there were three spicy condiments on the table that helped me make it spicy. It's not my favorite ramen place in Boston, but I'm glad I visited
Name: Hot Pot Buffet; Review: One of the worst hot pot places I ever been and I have been to a few. First the price is 24 for dinner which is really good all you can eat. From there everything else is horrible their seafood in the menu are disgusting they are so old and spoiled they smell horrible and all the seafood is covered what looks like dirt. Looks like brown pieces all over almost all the seafood. Also the seafood taste really frezzer burned. As for there meats I had beef tongue I cooked it for less than 4 seconds in the hotpot it was rubber I felt like I was eating piece of tire. The rest of their meat was just ok nothing special. As for their broth horrible as well I had the spicy broth with their house special. As for their spicy broth their was no spice it just looked spicy,my wife hates spicy food she tried the broth and said u sure they gave you the spicy food and their house special broth was from the sink we thought had no flavor tasted like water from the drain. I really dont care how a place looks like usually but this place was so dirty and so disgusting I felt I need a tetanus shot after

For spicy dishes, my favorites are the ""Pork and Eggplant with Yu Xiang Sauce"" which appears on their separate specials menu (it has perfect balance of spicy sauce, sweet eggplant, and savory pork), the Dan Dan Noodles (which the waiter should warn you need to be mixed before eating), any of the ""with Spicy Chili Sauce"" dishes (which are meat or fish served in a red spicy sauce with Napa Cabbage), the ""Old Sichuan Chicken"" (a dried fried chicken with an interesting crust -- the house specialty), the ""Gangou Dry Fish Filet"" (similar to the Old Sichuan Chicken but with fish), the ""Sliced Roast Beef & Tendon w. Chili Sauce"" (if you like tendon), and the ""Hot & Sour Wonton Soup"" (listed under ""Sichuan Delicacies"" not ""Soup"", and very different from a typical Americanized Hot & Sour).  For non-spicy dishes, I would recommend the Scallion Pancake (the only Americanized appetizer I would recommend here),""Sichuan Cold Noodles - none spicy"" (cold noodles in a vinegary peanut sauce), ""Sichuan Style String Beans"" (a Sichuan classic, and done very well here), ""Meat Ball Sichuan Style"" (A soup-like hot pot with huge meatballs and lots of vegetables), and the Sesame Sweet Potato Cakes (A hot soft sweet-potato pancake that is stuffed with a sweet bean paste, coated in sesame seeds, and drizzled with a sweet sauce).  This restaurant also has fancier locations in Framingham and Brookline, but the food is much better in Billerica. If you're looking for authentic or spicy food, it's worth the drive
Name: The Halal Guys; Review: I used to live across the street from a Halal Guys in Chicago so I was happy they have one here in Boston. When you compare it to other fast-casual chains like Cava, Sweet Green, or Chipotle, it's definitely more ""bare bones"" and less fancy. They definitely don't have a ""health"" equity and they don't have many options. But dang this place is delicious. I always get the regular combo platter which comes with beef and chicken, yellow rice, lettuce, and tomatoes. It's also a significant portion for the price which I appreciate.  Servers are friendly but there's not much seating so better to-go than eat-in.  Come in for a quick bite and get the white sauce and a little spicy (it's VERY spicy and I tend to like spicy)  Share review Write an update Edit revie","Name: Spice & Pepper; Review: Fresh and clean and tasty and pretty in all respects ... except - everything was somewhat sweet (a charge sometimes made against thai food, but this seemed more actively sugared than elsewhere, at least slightly) - pad thai is not like what you have had elsewhere, wee noodles, low in crunchy things, slightly scant as to shrimp size and quantity, low in peanuts too - 'creation corner' garlic squid spicy level 1 had zero spiciness, sweet, veg v fresh, lots of liquid, = meaning almost a brothy soup, and again it coulda had more squid; next time I will ask for spicy 2, and this from someone who does not love 'hot' food at all - everything is on the salty side, but what else is new? - brown rice, extra, is perfect -  quite fair, even good value, so just order doubles of things and move the protein to one and save the second for leftovers later; maybe do not fear ordering spicy 2, and if so inclined spicy
Name: Spicy World; Review: The food is good, but the service is not good at all... I had to ask for two things again because they overlooked what I wrote on the menu that you're supposed to fill out. Also, the container on tables where skewers are thrown out need to be cleaned! The servers just remove the empty skewers and leave the dirty containers for next customers. I was appalled, looked so disgusting.  Also, the staff need to learn how to say thank you or sorry when they miss something. I was actually afraid to ask for water towards the end
Name: Mumbai Spice; Review: Not a big fan of writting negative stuff. But unfriendly staff. Like the main waitress was kind of rude may be she had a long day. Food I would say was ok. I would suggest never try lamb or goat because the meat is never tender this is my second experience. I ordered a goat biryani. There were tiny tiny bones so it was really uncomfortable to eat, I ate just two spoons and gave up, well goat and lamb is with bones but tiny bones are really risky if you swallow you might get choked. Biryani was I would say atleast a week old ( easily figures out with the taste and size of the rice grain) was very spicy, the masala was not in proportion. Goan curry was amazing loved the taste. Nan was ok no complains. Kachori chat was also ok.  One more thing I was not sure of they already add tips which I guess was 15% and do they expect us to write more tips because below of the invoice there was suggestion for tips. Not sure. Overall I would give one more try and see if they can make some changes
Name: China Gourmet Restaurant; Review: Totally not spicy. The taste is ok, but the Hunan cuisine has been improved. Jintang fat beef pickled pepper taste is too light, sour and spicy appetizers can not be done. The chopped peppers in the chopped pepper fish head looked much, but in fact there was nothing spicy. Look at Fuzhou cuisine like this.

The 3 pepper mark of heat is like 5 pepper mark anywhere else i usually eat. Whew","Name: Amateras Ramen; Review: TL;DR - flavorful ramen at reasonable prices served by friendly and attentive staff. Heed the spice warnings on the menu.  Amateras ramen seems to be a popular spot for a quick bowl of ramen on those plentiful chilly Boston days. We went there around 5:45pm on a Thursday night and were seated immediately. The boiled gyoza appetizer was great - the wrappers were some of the softest ones I'd ever tasted. My 5X spicy miso ramen was flavorful. I didn't know how Amateras' spice scale compared relative to other places so I started there, but next time I will definitely be going 10x. My husband's level 2 spicy green monster was definitely the spicier of the two. The thai chiles in the clear broth definitely packed a punch.  The staff is polite, friendly, and attentive. Our waters were kept filled, table was set and cleared promptly, and our server processed our payment quickly

Name: Avana Sushi; Review: The sushi is high quality and fairly priced. I recommend takeout as the restaurant is not ideal for eating inside. We enjoyed the rainbow roll, spicy tuna, spicy crab, calamari and eel-avocado roll. 5 stars

Name: India Quality Restaurant; Review: If this is the quality of food in India, then I do not want to go. It blows my mind that it has such great reviews.  For starters, the place looks dirty and isn't welcoming. The waiters were many but none of them took care of us.  Now on to the disappointing food. We ordered many things because we were excited the place had such praising reviews. I even asked how long they have been in business, 31 years and counting.  We got samosas as starters, they were nothing but a frozen flash fried catastrophe. The garlic naan bread was drenched in oil, had too much garlic and wasn't cooked throughout. This was also for the second naan, pashwari which had too much honey in it.  The diet cokes we ordered came in a dirty glass, as a matter of fact all the glasses we got were dirty.  I had lamb madras, it was a watery flavorless substance that I did not recognize as being that dish. The taste was only of spiciness and the lamb felt more like a rubbery beef. We also got chicken korma and it was distasteful as well. The rice we got was too flavorful with spices they used and it took away from other flavors.  The bill wasn't cheap and definitely not worth the money. I do not recommend this place to anyone. Please don't waste your time and money

Name: Suishaya; Review: Friends of mine took me once to this place, with Korean and Japanese styles dishes, inside Chinatown hood.  If you look for a fork, knife or spoon, don't look for them, it's supposed to use your provided chopsticks and in case you order something that it's mandary in order to help eating it, they will be provided.  This was my first Korean restaurant in the US, so I declined their Sushi section in the menu and I headed to the Korean dishes.  First of all, you'll get some apetizers as red beans, bean spouts, carrot with chilli.  First time I tried Okdol Bibimbap, it came in a really hot pan, with all the ingredients ready to be cooked in it and a small recipient with spicy sauce. You have to be fast and start mixing it to don't get your food burnt. I ordered it with spicy pork, so it was spicy and very hot, it took me more than half hour to finish it, the amount of food also was big tho. My experience was food, the food, service and the local were good.  The second time I had Jam Bang with Korean noodle, also a big bowl came to the table, with the usual thick Korean noddles, mussels, shrimps and a selection of vegetables. As it was raining it was the perfect choice, it was both hot and spicy. The noodles and the soup were tasty and flavourful, I usually don't eat soup but this one it was really worth it.  As I came with some friends both times I tried Bulgogi Beef, that was pretty good.  The only bad things is they don't have beer nor home made tea, so don't expect anything good for drink.  The second time the fire alarm was triggered as some dishes are really hot and smoke comes out of them, but it's a mere anecdote
